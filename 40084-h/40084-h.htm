<p class="cap">A PICTURE within a picture&mdash;there is a romance
surrounding every canvas, a story hidden away with every product of the
pencil or brush. Our frontispiece, &quot;The Queen&#39;s First
Baby,&quot; provides an excellent example. During the first few years of
Her Majesty&#39;s married life a room in Buckingham Palace was fitted up
with all necessities for printing etchings, and here the Queen and
Prince Consort would come and take impressions of their own work from
the printing press. It is such a one that we are enabled to
reproduce&mdash;a <i>fac-simile</i> of an etching, sketched in the first
place, prepared and put on the press, and finally printed by the Royal
mother of the little one it represents. The original etching is now in
the possession of the writer. It is probably the earliest picture known
of the Empress Frederick of Germany, Princess Royal at the
time&mdash;for the etching bears date February 22, 1841, when the
Princess was but three months old. Every line, every item betokens how
anxious the Royal artist was to obtain a faithful drawing of her first
child, whose name, &quot;Victoria,&quot; is written under it. The little
Princess is so held that the nurse&#39;s face is quite concealed, and in
no way divides the attention the mother was desirous of winning for her
little one. When the Queen was making the sketch, a cage with a parrot
had been placed on a table near at hand, in order to rivet the
child&#39;s attention. The whole thing is suggestive of the simplicity
and homeliness which characterised the dispositions of the Royal workers
at the press; and we think the picture tells its own history of life in
the Palace fifty years ago.</p>

<p class="caption">HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA.<br />
<i>The first portrait painted after her Coronation.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The history as to how the first portrait of Her
Majesty after her coronation was obtained is also full of interest. The
Queen is represented in all her youthful beauty in the Royal box at
Drury Lane Theatre, and it is the work of E. T. Parris, a fashionable
portrait painter of those days. Parris was totally ignorant of the fact
that when he agreed with Mr. Henry Graves, the well-known publisher, to
paint &quot;the portrait of a lady for fifty guineas,&quot; he would
have to localise himself amongst the musical instruments of the
orchestra of the National Theatre, and handle his pencil in the
immediate neighbourhood of the big drum. Neither was he made aware as to
the identity of his subject until the eventful night arrived. Bunn was
the manager of Drury Lane at the time, and he flatly refused to
accommodate Mr. Graves with two seats in the orchestra. But the solution
of the difficulty was easy. Bunn was indebted to Grieve, the scenic
artist, for a thousand pounds. Grieve was persuaded to threaten to issue
a writ for the money unless the &quot;order for two&quot; was
forthcoming. Bunn succumbed, and the publisher triumphed; and whilst the
young Queen watched the performance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
she was innocently sitting for her picture to Parris and Mr. Graves, who
were cornered in the orchestra. Parris afterwards shut himself up in his
studio, and never left it until he had finished his work. The price
agreed upon was doubled, and the Queen signified her approval of the
tact employed by purchasing a considerable number of the engravings. The
reproduction of the picture in these pages becomes the more interesting
from the fact that it is done by permission of the still living occupant
of one of the two orchestra seats&mdash;Mr. Henry Graves.</p>

<p class="caption">IN THE ORCHESTRA: SKETCHING THE QUEEN.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Much might be said regarding missing and mutilated
pictures. The story as to how Gainsborough&#39;s &quot;Duchess of
Devonshire&quot; was cut from the frame a few days after 10,100 guineas
had been paid for it is well known, but we may add a scrap of
information hitherto unpublished, which will, we think, add somewhat to
the value of the work as a picture with a history. The ingenious thief
knew very well that in order to get his prize in safety through the
streets it would be necessary to roll it up. This, of course, could not
be done without cracking the paint. Accordingly, he had provided himself
with paste and paper to lay over the picture. But when he came to lay
the paper on the canvas, he found that he had forgotten&mdash;a brush!
The people who flocked to see the beautiful &quot;Duchess&quot; were
kept at a respectful distance by the customary barrier of silken rope.
The clever purloiner cut off a few inches of the thick cord, and,
fraying out one of the ends, improvised a really excellent substitute
wherewith to lay on the paste. The brush of rope was found next morning
on the floor, where he had left it, and told a story of such ingenuity
as certainly demands a word of recognition.</p>

<p class="indent">It is probable that were a novelist to concoct a plot
out of the story surrounding a certain Sir Joshua Reynolds in the
possession of Lord Crewe, the public would snap their fingers at it and
dub the whole thing ridiculous and impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">A former Lord Crewe had a picture painted of his son
and daughter. Though the faces were faithful, the attitudes of the
figures were somewhat fanciful; the daughter is holding a vase, and the
boy is posing as a cupid. When the son had grown to manhood he
quarrelled with his father, and he, to mark his extreme anger, caused
the cupid to be cut out of the canvas, giving instructions for it to be
destroyed, and a tripod painted in its place. Thus it remained for over
a hundred years. But the little cupid was not lost. It had, by some
mysterious means, after this lapse of time, found its way into the hands
of a dealer, who recognised it, having seen an engraving of the original
before it was cut. He immediately communicated with the present Lord
Crewe, who still had the picture. It was found that the cupid fitted
exactly into the space where the tripod stood. Lord Crewe not only
caused the cupid to be restored to its proper place, but, in order to
commemorate this remarkable incident, took out the now historical
tripod, had a piece of canvas with appropriate scenery painted, and
caused the tripod to be inserted therein. The cupid now hangs in his
house as a memento of a strange act on the part of one of his
ancestors.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Cheylesmore, well known as having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
one of the finest collections of Landseers in the world, has a dog
painted by this great artist, with a curious story attached to it. After
Charles Landseer had all but completed the painting of his celebrated
picture of &quot;Charles I. at Edge Hill,&quot; he persuaded his brother
Edwin to paint in a dog. This Sir Edwin consented to do; and, after the
work was engraved, the original got into the hands of a dealer, who
cleverly cut out the dog, and had another put in place of it. He secured
the services of an able artist to paint a background for the animal
which had been so ignominiously deprived of the honour of reclining in
the presence of Charles I. This he sold as a Landseer&mdash;as, indeed,
it was; and this highly interesting little creature is the one now owned
by Lord Cheylesmore. As regards that of &quot;Charles I. at Edge
Hill,&quot; we believe we are correct in saying that it was recently
purchased by the Walker Art Gallery at Liverpool.</p>

<p class="indent">A somewhat similar circumstance befell Holbein&#39;s
famous picture of &quot;The Field of the Cloth of Gold,&quot; which
hangs at Hampton Court Palace. After the execution of Charles I.,
Cromwell proposed to sell many of the late monarch&#39;s pictures to
dealers and others who approached him on the subject, and amongst others
that painted by Holbein. Negotiations for the purchase concluded, the
time came round for its delivery. On examining &quot;The Field of the
Cloth of Gold&quot; it was discovered that one of the principal
faces&mdash;that of Henry VIII.&mdash;had been cut out in a complete
circle. Naturally, the dealer&mdash;a foreigner&mdash;declined to
conclude the bargain, and the mutilated Holbein was stowed away. After
the Restoration, a nobleman appeared at court and begged Charles II. to
graciously accept an article which the king might possibly be glad to
know was still preserved to the English nation. It proved to be a
circular piece of canvas, representing the robust countenance of Henry
VIII., which the nobleman had himself cut from the picture in
Cromwell&#39;s time. This great work was seen at the Tudor Exhibition
last year, the mark of the circle being plainly visible.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;THE CHILDREN THREW THEIR MARBLES AT THE BEAUTY.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The fact of a picture worth £10,000 being converted
into a sort of bullseye mark for schoolboys&#39; marbles is a little
history in itself. The work, by Gainsborough, is that of the Honourable
Miss Duncombe&mdash;a renowned beauty of her day, who lived at Dalby
Hall, near Melton Mowbray. She married General Bowater. For over fifty
years this magnificent work of art had hung in the hall of this old
house in Leicestershire, and the children, as they played and romped
about the ancient oaken staircases, delighted to make a target of the
Gainsborough, and to throw their marbles at the beauty. It hung there
year after year, full of holes, only to be sold under the hammer one day
for the sum of £6, a big price for the torn and tattered canvas. The
owner of the bargain let it go for £183 15s., the lucky purchaser this
time being Mr. Henry Graves. The day it came into the famous
printseller&#39;s shop in Pall Mall, Lord Chesterfield offered 1,000
guineas for it, at which price it was sold. But romances run freely
amongst all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
things pertaining to pictures, for before the work was delivered a fever
seized Lord Chesterfield and he died. Lady Chesterfield was informed
that, if she wished, the agreement might be cancelled. Her ladyship
replied that she was glad of this, as she did not require the picture,
which accordingly remained in Mr. Graves&#39; shop waiting for another
purchaser. It had not long to wait. One of the wealthiest and most
discriminating judges of pictures in England, Baron Lionel Rothschild,
came in search of it, and the following conversation between him and the
owner, Mr. Graves, ensued:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/Scan230-1.jpg" width="457" height="690" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">THE HONOURABLE MISS DUNCOMBE. <i>By Gainsborough.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ask me fifteen hundred guineas for it?&quot;
exclaimed the great financier, when he was told the price; &quot;why,
you sold it the other day for a thousand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know I did,&quot; replied the dealer,
&quot;but that was done in a hurry, before it had been
restored.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, now I&#39;ll give you twelve hundred for
it&mdash;twelve hundred,&quot; said the Baron, looking longingly at the
work.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Baron,&quot; said Mr. Graves,
good-humouredly, though firmly, &quot;if you beat me down another
shilling, you shan&#39;t have the picture at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good&mdash;then send it home at fifteen
hundred guineas.&quot; It is now amongst the most valued artistic
treasures of the Rothschilds, and £10,000 would not buy it to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">The two illustrations we now give of
pictures&mdash;one of which is still missing and the other recovered
after a long lapse of time&mdash;are both after Sir Joshua Reynolds. It
is certain that the missing one will never be seen again. Reward after
reward has been offered, but all to no avail&mdash;&quot;The Countess of
Derby,&quot; by Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
Joshua, so far as the original goes, is a thing of the past. The mystery
as to its sudden disappearance has never been fully cleared up, but it
is indisputable that the Earl of Derby of the period had this picture
painted of his wife, that he quarrelled with her, and that just at this
time the picture vanished. Little room is left for doubt that the Earl
himself destroyed the work.</p>

<p class="caption">THE COUNTESS OF DERBY. <i>By Sir Joshua Reynolds.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The other is that of Miss Gale, painted when she was
fifteen, a canvas worth at least £5,000 (page
<a href="#Scan232">232</a>). She married Admiral Gardner, who was so
much attached to his wife, that whenever he went to sea he always took
the picture with him, and had it conspicuously hung up in his cabin. His
vessel was wrecked off the West Indies, and though the Admiral was
saved, the ship, with &quot;Miss Gale&quot; in the cabin, went down.
There it lay at the bottom of the ocean for a considerable period, until
at last attempts were made to recover it. This was successfully
accomplished, though the canvas was much damaged, and was afterwards
reduced in length and breadth. The picture seems to have been peculiarly
unfortunate, both on land and sea, for in 1864 it was damaged again by
the Midland Railway. Until recently it was in the possession of the Rev.
Allen Gardner Cornwall.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">The fact of a picture of fabulous value being picked
up in a pawnbroker&#39;s shop, or veritable gems being discovered
fastened with tin-tacks to the wall of a servant&#39;s bedroom, is alone
sufficient cause to rank them among pictures with a history. But surely
no such remarkable instance of innocence regarding the real value of a
work has been known for a long time as that which came to light in a
West End picture dealer&#39;s shop a few weeks ago. The story is a
simple one. A painter&mdash;presumably an amateur&mdash;ran short of
canvas, and, living in the country, some days must needs elapse before
he could get a fresh supply. Hanging up in his house was an old work,
representing an ancient-looking gentleman. He had hung there a long
time, practically unnoticed. To meet the emergency, the painter
conceived a happy thought, and one which he immediately proceeded to
carry into effect. Why not paint on the back of the ancient-looking
gentleman who had hung uncared-for for so long? The canvas was taken off
the stretcher, turned round, and re-stretched, the back of the picture
being used on which to paint a copy of Sir Joshua Reynolds&#39;
&quot;Age of Innocence.&quot; Innocence there truly was&mdash;for the
painting which the amateur had screened from view turned out to be a
Gainsborough. The original Gainsborough is at the present moment at the
back of the newly-painted picture, and is partly hidden by the
stretcher, as shown in the sketch (page <a href="#Scan233">233</a>),
made as it lay by the counter in the dealer&#39;s shop.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">

<p class="caption">THE HIDDEN &quot;GAINSBOROUGH.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">One artist might be singled out of whom it may safely
be said that he never painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
a picture without a history attached to it. Landseer&#39;s works abound
in suggestive incident and delightful romance. He would paint out of
sheer gratitude a picture worth £10,000 simply because an admirer, for
whom he had executed a commission, had expressed his approval of the
artist&#39;s genius, by paying him more money than that originally
agreed upon. Such an incident as this was the means of bringing
Landseer&#39;s brush to work on &quot;The Maid and the Magpie,&quot; now
in the National Gallery.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two or three anecdotes&mdash;hitherto
unpublished, we believe&mdash;relating to pictures with histories, and
associated with Landseer&#39;s name.</p>

<p class="indent">It is said&mdash;and results have proved how
justly&mdash;that Landseer never forgot a dog after once seeing it.
&quot;The Shepherd&#39;s Bible&quot; is a rare instance of this. Mr.
Jacob Bell referred to this work as &quot;the property of a gentleman
who was for many years a candidate for a picture by Sir E. Landseer, and
kept a collie dog in the hope that he might some day be so fortunate as
to obtain his portrait.&quot; The collie, however, died. Some two years
afterwards, its owner received a note from Sir Edwin appointing a day
for a sitting. Fortunately, he had provided himself with another dog,
hoping yet to secure the services of the greatest of all animal
painters, and taking the creature with him, kept the appointment on the
day named. He told Landseer that the old favourite was dead, and gave a
description of his colour and general appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; the painter replied, &quot;I know
the dog exactly,&quot; and he made a sketch which proved the truth of
his words. The picture was painted in less than two days, and the
portrait of the dead animal was exact, even to the very expression of
the dog&#39;s eye.</p>

<p class="indent">Landseer, too, was often very happy in his choice of a
subject. &quot;Dignity and Impudence&quot; is one of the treasures of
the National Gallery, and though the one is a fine bloodhound named
&quot;Grafton,&quot; and the other a little terrier called
&quot;Scratch,&quot; it is likely that two gentlemen innocently
suggested the whole thing to him. It seems that one day Landseer entered
a picture shop, and was annoyed at the way in which he was treated by
one of the assistants, who mistook him for a customer, and who addressed
him in a style a trifle too pushing and businesslike to suit his
taste.</p>

<p class="indent">Just then the proprietor entered, a fine, handsome,
dignified man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, have you got anything new in the way of a
picture?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Landseer, &quot;but I&#39;ve
just got a subject. I&#39;ll let you know when it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
finished.&quot; The result was the picture referred to, and it is said
that the grand bloodhound bore a striking resemblance to the picture
dealer, whilst the little terrier, presumably, was suggested by the
assistant; whose manner, after all, was simply that of a sharp man of
business.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s Life in the Old Dog Yet,&quot;
another fine work, was, in 1857, the property of Mr. Henry McConnell,
for whom it was painted in 1838. Mr. McConnell was asked if he would
lend it to the Art Treasures Exhibition at Manchester. He had a very
great horror of railway travelling, but agreed to grant the request on
one condition, that the picture, with the others asked for, should be
sent down by road. Everything was packed up, and the precious load
started on its journey. The van had got about half-way to Manchester,
when, in passing over a level crossing&mdash;common enough in those
days&mdash;the horses were startled by an approaching train. It was
impossible to get across the lines in time, and the engine dashed into
the van, shattering many of the pictures, including &quot;There&#39;s
Life in the Old Dog Yet.&quot; So great was the destruction that when
the driver went to the front wheel of the engine, he found entwined
round it a piece of the canvas of this famous picture.</p>

<p class="indent">An anecdote might be told regarding &quot;The
Cavalier&#39;s Pets,&quot; further illustrating the rapid rate at which
Landseer worked, and the fate which seemed to hang over his canine
subjects. The dogs were pets of Mr. Vernon&#39;s, and a sketch was made
in his house as a commission to Sir Edwin. It seems, however, that
Landseer forgot all about it, until some time afterwards he was met by
the owner of the pets in the street, who gently reminded him of his
little commission. In two days the work as it is now seen was completed
and delivered, though not a line had been put on the canvas previous to
the meeting. Both the beautiful creatures came to an untimely end. The
white Blenheim spaniel was killed by a fall from a table, whilst the
King Charles fell through the railings of a staircase at his
master&#39;s house, and was picked up dead at the bottom of the
steps.</p>

<p class="indent">We cannot do better than conclude with an anecdote
which connects this great painter with the early life of Her
Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">That the Queen has always displayed a marked interest
in works of art is indisputable. Her collection of pictures, many of
them of the Flemish and Dutch schools, her Vandykes and Rubens, are
almost priceless. But Her Majesty&#39;s favours bestowed on matters
artistic have also drifted into home channels, as witness her generous
spirit shown at all times towards Sir Edwin Landseer.</p>

<p class="indent">Amongst all the priceless works to be found in the
Royal galleries, one picture may here be singled out with a pleasing
story attached to it. &quot;Loch Laggan&quot; shows the Queen in a quiet
and unassuming gown, beside her camp-stool, at which she has a few
moments before been sketching. The Princess Royal and the Prince of
Wales are there as children. In the centre stands a pony with a burden
of deer on its back, its owner, a stalwart Highlander, at its head, with
an expression of countenance half-amused, half-surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Edwin Landseer&mdash;who painted the
picture&mdash;was at the time in Scotland giving lessons to the Queen.
Whilst on his way to Balmoral he wandered in the direction of Loch
Laggan, and became perplexed as to which path to take. Espying the
Highlander, he bade him hasten to find the Queen, and say that Sir Edwin
would reach her ere long. The man needed no second bidding, and jumped
on the pony&#39;s back. He had not proceeded far round the lake before
he drew up his pony in front of a lady, who was sketching, whilst her two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
children were busying themselves by handing her the various drawing
implements as required.</p>

<p class="indent">Respectfully removing his cap, he asked if she could
tell him where he might possibly find the Queen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; replied the lady, turning from
her drawing, &quot;I am the Queen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was too much for the worthy Scot. He could not
associate the great stone on which Her Majesty had been sitting with all
the splendour of a throne. All he could do was to put his hands upon his
knees and suggestively utter the single
word&mdash;&quot;<i>Gammon!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time Sir Edwin had arrived. He drew the
picture with the Highlander in the very act of relieving himself of an
expression not often heard in the presence of Royalty. Our drawing is a
sketch of the figures in the painting of this highly interesting
scene.</p>

There were other anomalies, too numerous to mention, in the room; for
this was one of the workshops of the curious Kingdom of Make-Believe, of
which, at the present time, if we may except the aforesaid company, John
Farley was the solitary occupant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/Scan235-2.jpg" width="507" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;DAUBS.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">John Farley, nicknamed &quot;Daubs,&quot; was
scene-painter of the Comedy Theatre, Porchester, and this was the room
whence proceeded those marvellous designs that stirred the gallery to
enthusiastic applause, the boxes to derisive laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the season of pantomime. The curtain had been
rung down upon the &quot;grand phantasmagorical, allegorical, and
whimsicorical&quot; legend of &quot;King Pippin,&quot; and the denizens
of that monarch&#39;s court&mdash;or, rather, their faces&mdash;were
resting peacefully from their labours on the wall. John Farley, too, was
presumably resting from <i>his</i> labours, for he was sitting upon a
wooden stool, smoking vigorously, and gazing, with a far-away glance,
into the region of Nowhere. It was not a satisfied expression, this of
John Farley&#39;s&mdash;no, decidedly not. It appeared to have a quarrel
with the world, but did not seem to know precisely at which quarter of
it to commence hostilities. Truth to tell, he was a disappointed man. He
had started life, as many another, with high aims and ambitions, and
they had brought him no better fruit than scene-painter to the
Porchester Theatre, with, instead of academic diplomas and honours, the
unflattering title of &quot;Daubs!&quot; Do you wonder, then, that
sitting there, a man verging upon the &quot;thirties,&quot; he looked
upon life with little love, and upon the constituents of its big
constituency with little admiration?</p>

<p class="indent">John had a private grievance as well as a public. He
lived in a flat of a block of houses situate in Seymour-street, about a
quarter of an hour&#39;s walk from the theatre. For some days past he
had determined on making another bid for fame and fortune by painting a
grand picture. He had commenced various designs for this
&quot;masterpiece,&quot; but none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
of them had proved entirely satisfactory. And now, as though to
frustrate all his hopes, a new source of disturbance had arisen. John
possessed one of those mercurial, nervous temperaments, born principally
of a morbid, solitary life, which demanded absolute quiet for any
profitable employment of the intellect. For this reason he detested the
atmosphere of a theatre, and for this reason he yet more detested the
fate that had cast his fortunes in its midst. In the apartments where he
lived, mean as they were, he usually found tranquillity. He could at
least think, smoke, sketch, or write, as the fit took him, without
disturbance. But now, just at the time when he most desired and needed
quiet, the bugbear he fled had attacked him in his very stronghold.</p>

<p class="indent">In the rooms beneath those he occupied lived a poor
widow with her two children, a boy and girl. John knew this much from
the landlady. He knew, too, that the boy was employed at the Comedy
Theatre. Further than this he had not cared to inquire. Usually they
were as quiet as the proverbial mouse, but latterly John&#39;s ears had
been afflicted with groans and cries of pain, proceeding from the
widow&#39;s apartments, and kept up with aggravating regularity
throughout the night. They were the cries of a child&mdash;no doubt
about that&mdash;and a child in great suffering. A person less centred
in his own projects than John might have at least felt some sympathy
with the sufferer, but John had evidently lost kinship with the deeper
emotions, and instead of sympathy he experienced only a feeling of
annoyance and keen resentment against the widow and &quot;her
brats,&quot; as he styled them. Thus it was that, think as he would, the
subject of this grand picture which was to take the world by storm and
out-Raphael Raphael, persisted in evading him; and thus it is we find
him, in a more cynical mood than usual, at the Comedy Theatre, in no
haste to return to the scene of his failures.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the use of striving?&quot; mused John,
as he slowly puffed his pipe. &quot;One might as well throw up the
sponge. Fate is too much for me. He follows at my elbow everywhere. His
usual running-ground is not enough for him. Now he follows me home, and
gives me a solo of his own peculiar music through one of his
imps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A timid knock sounded upon the door. John was busy
with his thoughts, and did not hear it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That theory of Longfellow&#39;s is
correct&mdash;art <i>is</i> long. In what sphere could you find a
longer? Supportable might this be, but cold indifference to a poor devil
aching for a gleam of sympathy is insupportable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The knock at the door was repeated, but with the same
effect as before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The grinning public&mdash;just tickle its side:
that is all it needs. He who caters most to its stupidity in life is he
who gains the proud distinction of a public mausoleum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
at his death. I have not got quite into the way, but still I see in
perspective a monument dedicated to&mdash;&#39;Daubs.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A sound, light as gossamer wing, was heard in the
room. John Farley turned his head. Then he stared; then he rubbed his
eyes; then he stared again. Well he might. Was this an offspring of the
immortal whom he had just been apostrophising?</p>

<p class="indent">It was decidedly an imp&mdash;at least it had the
apparel of one. It was clothed in scarlet; dependent from its haunches
was a tail; on its head a Satanic cowl. But there was melancholy rather
than mischief in its eye, and it was of a restful, confiding brown
rather than an unrestful, flashing black.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 624px;">
<img src="images/Scan236.jpg" width="624" height="526" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;IT WAS AN IMP.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">John again inserted his knuckles in his eyes, and
waved off the smoke from his pipe. And then he recognised his uncanny
visitor. It was the little son of the widow who lived under his flat. He
was one of the imps of King Pippin&#39;s kingdom in the pantomime, and
doomed for a small pittance to indulge his apish tricks nightly with the
gnomes and fairies of that fanciful realm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Daubs!&quot; said the imp.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, only that was necessary to incite John&#39;s
wrath. A nickname that was supportable from the actors and
scene-shifters was insupportable from a child.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Daubs&quot; therefore turned sharply upon the
boy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you referring to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John was on the point of brusquely informing the lad
that he was not acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Daubs, and
peremptorily showing him the door. A glance from the honest brown eyes,
however, restrained him. It told him that what he had at first assumed
to be impudence was really the result of ignorance&mdash;that, and only
that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would like to know you, Mr. Daubs. You
don&#39;t mind knowing a little boy&mdash;do you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John opened his eyes in astonishment. What a curious
imp! John was not aware that anybody had any particular desire for his
society; in fact, the reverse had hitherto seemed the case. He was
usually regarded as an unsociable being.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not the least objection to making your
acquaintance,&quot; said he, <i>un</i>reluctantly, it must be
confessed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; said the little fellow,
drawing nearer, and putting his hand confidingly in John&#39;s, and
looking up at him with bright, happy eyes. &quot;Then perhaps I
may&mdash;may I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What &quot;may I&quot; meant was a gentle pressure of
the lips upon the smoky cheek of John. If John had been astonished
before he was still more astonished now&mdash;so much so that the pipe
he was smoking fell from his fingers, and was broken into fragments on
the floor. What had he, a grumpy bachelor, to do with kissing? Twenty
years had passed since his cheek had felt the pressure of lips, and then
they were the death-cold lips of a younger brother&mdash;surely about
the size of this strange imp&mdash;who had left him with that dumb
farewell for ever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your name, my lad?&quot; said he,
softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Willie Maxwell. Mother calls me &#39;her
Willie.&#39; Dodo&mdash;that is my sister, you know&mdash;when she is
well&quot; (here the little fellow sighed) &quot;says that I&#39;m her
pet. But at the theatre I&#39;m only known as &#39;Fourth Imp.&#39; Mr.
Billings&quot;&mdash;Mr. Billings was the stage-manager of the
Comedy&mdash;&quot;has promised that, if I&#39;m a good boy, I shall
some day be First Imp!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be a rise in the world, and no
mistake,&quot; remarked John.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Mr. Daubs, it will be a little more money
for mother&mdash;threepence extra a night&mdash;but I shouldn&#39;t like
to push out Teddy Morris. You know Teddy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John was obliged to confess that he had not the honour
of that young gentleman&#39;s acquaintance. He never troubled himself
with anything or anybody outside his own department.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Teddy Morris is First Imp. He doesn&#39;t like
me, you know, because he thinks I&#39;m&mdash;what do you call it, Mr.
Daubs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ambitious?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, &#39;bitious, that&#39;s the
word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John&#39;s crusty humour was gradually melting, and he
smiled&mdash;first, at anyone disliking this frank, affectionate boy;
next, at the rivalry of the imps. &quot;All the world,&quot; thought he,
&quot;is indeed a stage, and the struggle for a position on it extends
to strange quarters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I&#39;m not &#39;bitious, Mr.
Daubs&quot;&mdash;here Willie paused, and deliberately climbed on
John&#39;s knee&mdash;&quot;no, I really ain&#39;t, &#39;cept of
you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John started at this bold confession. He was on the
point of exploding into loud laughter, but the brown eyes were looking
earnestly into his, and with these searching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
witnesses before him John thought that such an ebullition of mirth would
be little short of profanation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you&#39;re ambitious of me, are you? Well,
my little man, if it&#39;s your intention to supplant me as
scene-painter to the Comedy Theatre, I&#39;m exceedingly grateful to you
for giving me due notice of the fact. Only let me know when you think I
ought to resign my position, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; assented Willie, with childish
<i>naïveté</i>; and then, putting his head nearer to John&#39;s, as
though to take him into still closer confidence&mdash;&quot;Do you know,
I&#39;ve often seen you, and wanted to speak to you, but somehow
I&#39;ve not liked to. I&#39;ve watched you when you weren&#39;t
looking, and you&#39;ve always seemed to look like&mdash;you don&#39;t
mind a little boy saying it, Mr. Daubs&mdash;like that.&quot; Willie
pointed to a mask of one of the ogres. John did not think the comparison
very flattering, and felt very uncomfortable. The next instant the child
was nestling closer to him; a pair of thin arms were clasped tightly
round John&#39;s neck; and the lips which again pressed his whispered
softly: &quot;But you&#39;re not a bit like that now, Mr.
Daubs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the comparison was forgiven, but not
forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, Willie, why you are ambitious of me?
Ambitious of me,&quot; John mentally added, &quot;who thought myself the
least envied mortal in the world!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Willie&#39;s only answer was to take John&#39;s big
hand into his small one; then he instituted a minute comparison between
the two; then he patted it fondly; then he dropped it suddenly, and
remained buried in deep thought. John gave himself up to the child&#39;s
whim. It was a delicious experience&mdash;the more delicious because
unexpected. This was an infantile world, made up of quaint ideas and
actions, of which even the memory had been almost obliterated from his
mind. Thought took him back to its last link&mdash;that which had been
rudely snapped by the death of his brother. He sighed, and the sigh was
echoed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be a long while&mdash;many years, I
suppose, Mr. Daubs&mdash;before my hand gets like yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Daubs thought it would be. Willie sighed again.
&quot;Painting&#39;s very hard, sir&mdash;ain&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 576px;">
<img src="images/Scan238.jpg" width="576" height="574" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;PAINTING&#39;S VERY HARD, SIR&mdash;AIN&#39;T IT?&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, my boy; it&#39;s the easiest thing in
the world,&quot; said the artist bitterly; &quot;and the world accepts
it at its right value, for it is never inclined to pay very dearly for
it. Just a few paints, a brush, and there you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Mr. Daubs, I hardly think that&#39;s quite
right&mdash;you don&#39;t mind my saying so, do you?&mdash;&#39;cause I
saved up a shilling and bought a paintbrush and some paints, and tried
ever so hard to make a picture, but it was no use. No, it was nothing
like a picture&mdash;all smudge, you know&mdash;so I thought that
p&#39;raps God never meant little boys should make pictures, and that I
would have to wait till I grew up like you, Mr. Daubs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s as well somebody should think I can
paint pictures; but do you know, my young art critic, that many persons
have no higher estimate of my efforts than you have of yours&mdash;that
is to say,&quot; seeing the eyes widening in astonishment, &quot;their
term for them is &#39;smudge!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, do they say that? No, Mr. Daubs, they
wouldn&#39;t dare,&quot; said Willie, indignantly. &quot;Why, you paint
lovely horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
and flowers, and trees, and mountains, and your birds, if they could
only sing, like the little bird Dodo once had, they would seem quite
alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John had never had so flattering, nor so unique a
criticism of his art. &quot;Molière,&quot; thought he, &quot;used to
read his plays to the children, and gather something from their prattle.
Why should I disdain opinion from a like source, especially as it chimes
in so beautifully with what my vanity would have had me acknowledge long
since?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, youngster, admitting that I am the fine
artist you would make of me, what then? In what way do you expect to
convert a world which prefers real horses, real trees, and real birds?
See, now, even here&mdash;at the Comedy Theatre&mdash;we have only to
announce on the playbills that a <i>real</i> horse, a <i>real</i>
steam-engine, or a <i>real</i> goose or donkey, for that matter, will be
exhibited, and the best efforts of my artistic genius are thrown into
the shade. You are a case in point. Could I draw an imp that would meet
with half the success that you do? But what nonsense I am
talking&mdash;you don&#39;t understand a word of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, Mr. Daubs, I do&mdash;something. Do you
know what I think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say on, youngster.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think we don&#39;t often know or think what
<i>is</i> best for us. Mother says little boys don&#39;t always know
what is best for them. &#39;Real&#39; is a live thing&mdash;ain&#39;t
it? I used to <i>think</i>, Mr. Daubs, you were a real live ogre once.
But now I know you ain&#39;t&mdash;are you?&quot; This with a pressure
of the arms again round John&#39;s neck. What could the &quot;real live
ogre&quot; say to such an appeal? After a pause: &quot;Mr. Daubs, can I
tell you something&mdash;may I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John assented, wondering what was the next strange
thing this curious sprite would ask.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And will you say &#39;yes&#39; to what I
ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John again assented, though he thought that possibly
his assent might necessitate a journey to Timbuctoo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I want you to make me&mdash;an
angel!&quot; And then he quickly added, seeing the startled expression
on John&#39;s face, &quot;You are so clever!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An angel!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, an angel. You won&#39;t say no?&quot; There
was a quiver of anxiety in the boy&#39;s tones. &quot;It&#39;s for
Dodo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Dodo! But, child, I&#39;m not a manufacturer
of angels!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you can draw birds. Birds have wings, and so
have angels, and it&#39;s for Dodo,&quot; he again repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">The logic of Willie&#39;s reasoning was irrefutable.
Where was John standing? He scarcely knew. He had caught the boy&#39;s
conception. This, then, was the reason of his anxiety to become an
artist. Never imp was surely such a seraph! The angel was for his
sister. They were her moans and cries John had heard in his lonely
chamber these three nights past, and it was with an angel her brother
hoped, in his childish imagination, to bring relief from pain and
suffering. With one quick flash of inspiration John saw it all&mdash;the
intense longing, the all-embracing love, the unselfishness, the
exquisite sense of bringing to suffering its one great alleviation. And
as he thought, John&#39;s head dropped, and a tear fell on the eager,
youthful face upturned to his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother says that all angels are in heaven, and
Dodo&#39;s always talking about angels. She says she wants to see one,
and would like one to come to her. But they can&#39;t, Mr. Daubs, unless
we first go to them. And I don&#39;t want&mdash;no, no, I don&#39;t
want&quot;&mdash;with a big
sob&mdash;&quot;Dodo&mdash;to&mdash;go&mdash;away. If <i>I</i> could
take it to her she would stay here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John&#39;s heart was full&mdash;full to overflowing.
He could scarcely speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go&mdash;go, and change your clothes, youngster,
and we will try to make you an angel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, thank you so much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a flash Willie was gone, and John was left alone.
&quot;Heaven help me!&quot; he said, with a tender, pathetic glance in
the direction whence the little figure had vanished; &quot;Heaven help
me!&quot; and John did what he had not done since his own brother died.
He fell upon his knees, and sent a hasty prayer heavenward for
inspiration. Then he took a large piece of cardboard, and some crayons,
and commenced&mdash;making an angel! He worked as one inspired. With
nervous, skilful fingers he worked. All was silent in the great city
below; the stillness lent inspiration to the artist&#39;s imagination.
Never had he seemed in closer touch with Heaven. To give John his due,
the petty contentions of men had always been beneath him, but the
&quot;peace which passeth understanding&quot; had never been his,
because of the selfishness by which his better nature had been warped.
Now, through this child&#39;s <i>un</i>selfishness, he almost heard the
flapping of angelic wings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
and he depicted them, in all their softened beauty, upon his cardboard,
with a face between that seemed to look out in ineffable love upon a
guilt-laden world. This was what the artist wrought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mr. Daubs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The exclamation was pregnant with meaning. Willie had
returned, and was devouring with open mouth and eyes the sketch of the
angel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, youngster, do you think that will do for
Dodo?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that&#39;s for Dodo?&quot; was the only
answer, for the boy was still absorbed in the artist&#39;s creation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you ever seen an angel, Mr. Daubs? Ah, you
must have. I knew you were clever at horses, and trees, and birds, and
skies, but I didn&#39;t guess you were so good at angels. It&#39;s just
what mother said they were!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, don&#39;t make me vain, but take it;
and&quot;&mdash;added John partly to himself, &quot;may the King of
Cherubim hold in reserve <i>his</i> messenger, not for a death-warrant,
but a blessing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, so much. But I&#39;m going to pay
you, you know.&quot; And Willie drew out proudly an old
pocket-handkerchief, and, applying his teeth vigorously to a special
corner of it, took therefrom a sixpence.</p>

<p class="indent">John smiled, but took the coin without a word. Then he
lifted the boy up, and kissed him tenderly. The next moment he was
alone; Willie had departed with his angel. The artist listened to the
pattering footsteps as they descended the stairs, then bowed his head
upon his arms, and what with his three nights of unrest, and thinking
over what he had been and might have been, fell into a profound
sleep.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Not long had he been in the land of counterpane, when
of a sudden there was a stir from without.</p>

<p class="indent">The night air was quick with cries, and a childish
treble seemed to echo and re-echo above them all. There was something
familiar in this latter sound. It was as a harsh note on a diapason that
had but recently brought him sweetest music.</p>

<p class="indent">In a moment John had gained the street. He had
connected the cry with one object&mdash;Willie. That object had for him
a value infinite, so quick in its power of attraction is the spark of
sympathy when once kindled. John&#39;s view of life had seemed, in this
last half-hour, to have greatly widened. It took account of things
previously unnoticed; it opened up feelings long dormant. His ear was
strangely sensitive to the beat of this new pulse&mdash;so much so that
a vague terror shaped itself out of that night-cry. It seemed to him to
portend disaster.</p>

<p class="indent">But surely his worst fears are realised! What is that
moving mass away in the distance? Soon John has reached the spot. He
hears a hum of sympathy, and then there is a reverential silence:
John&#39;s ears have caught the pitying accents of a bystander,
&quot;Poor lad! Heaven help him!&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;">
<img src="images/Scan240.jpg" width="568" height="539" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;WHAT IS THAT?&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Help him! Help whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John&#39;s mind is quick at inference. He parts the
crowd, and with certain glance looks upon its point of observation. He
knew it: no need of words to tell him. A little form is there, mangled
with the hoofs of a horse. Its life-blood is slowly oozing out on the
pavement. The face has the hue of death&mdash;no mistaking
that&mdash;and yet it has around it something of the halo of saintship.
John gazes as one distraught. The face he sees, now pinched with the
agonies of death, is that of Willie Maxwell!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God, is it possible?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But a brief moment or two since, it seemed to John,
this poor boy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
in the bloom of health, full of the radiant sunshine of life. Now the
finger of death had touched him, and he stood on the threshold of the
Kingdom of Shadows.</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant John was ready to launch again his
maledictions against Fate. The presence of this child had cast a ray of
sunshine on a sunless existence&mdash;had given to it a brief gleam of
happiness, which was flickering out in this tragic way on the roadside.
John had so frequently taken a selfish estimate of life, that even in
this supreme crisis that feeling was momentarily uppermost, but only
momentarily. The child was resting in the arms of a rough carman, and as
John looked a spasm of returning consciousness passed over the little
sufferer&#39;s frame. Then there was a faint moan. Was there a chance of
saving the boy&#39;s life? John came closer, and as he did so a light
seemed to radiate from the child&#39;s face on to his.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the eyes are looking at him in a pained, dazed
way. There is a gleam of recognition, and about the mouth flickers a
smile of content.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr.
Da&mdash;Da&mdash;Daubs,&mdash;I&#39;m&mdash;so&mdash;glad-you&#39;ve
&mdash;come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John kneels on the ground, and kisses the pale, cold
lips of the sufferer. The little arms are nervously at work; then with
an effort they are extended towards him: &quot;Will you please take
this, Mr. Daubs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John looked. It was the sketch of the angel!
&quot;I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t drop it. I held it tight, you see,
Mr. Daubs&mdash;oh, so tight! I was afraid Dodo wouldn&#39;t get it. No
one knows Dodo, you see. I can&#39;t&mdash;take&mdash;it&mdash;to
her&mdash;to-night; so&mdash;will you&mdash;please?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John&#39;s tears are falling fast upon the pavement.
He seems to hear the stifled sobs of the bystanders as he takes in his
hand the sketch of the angel. &quot;I shall&mdash;see
her&mdash;again&mdash;when the&mdash;light comes. Now&mdash;it
is&mdash;so dark&mdash;and cold&mdash;so cold!&quot; John mechanically
takes off his coat, and wraps it around the little form.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you&mdash;Mr.
Daubs&mdash;you&#39;re&mdash;a&mdash;kind&mdash;gentleman. May
I&mdash;may I?&quot;&mdash;&mdash;John had heard a similar request
before that evening, and thanked God that he knew what it meant. He bent
his face forward. &quot;That for dear&mdash;<i>dear</i> mother, and that
for&mdash;darling&mdash;sister&mdash;sister Dodo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As John&#39;s lips received the death-cold kisses, a
strange thing happened. The picture of the angel was suddenly wrested
from his grasp, and flew upward and upward, in shape like a bat. There
was a moment of mystery&mdash;of intense darkness and solemn silence.
Then the heavens were agleam with sunshine, and John seemed to see
radiant forms winging their way earthward. One of these outsped the
rest. Nearer and nearer it came, and John in wonderment fixed his gaze
intently thereon. He had never seen a real angel before, but he
recognised this one. It was the angel he had sketched, transfigured into
celestial life. It came to where the child rested, and John fell
backward, dazzled with its light. When he looked up again the child and
the angel had both vanished, and all was again dark.</p>

<hr />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan242.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;WAKE UP, WAKE UP!&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Daubs, Daubs! Wake up, wake up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John looked up with sleepy eyes. Where the deuce was
he? Not in any angelic presence, that was certain. The voice was not
pitched in a very heavenly key, and wafted odours of tobacco and beer
rather than frankincense and myrrh. John pinched himself to make sure he
was awake. This was assuredly no celestial visitor, but
Verges&mdash;that was his theatrical nickname&mdash;the Comedy Theatre
watchman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it you, Verges? Will you have the kindness to
tell me where I am?&quot; John looked around him in bewilderment. The
masks seemed grinning at him in an aggravating way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you are at present, Mister, in the Comedy
Theatre; but you was just now very soundly in the land of Nod, I guess.
You&#39;d make a splendid watchman, you would!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Verges&#39; denunciation came with beautiful
appropriateness, as he had just come from the public-house opposite,
where he had been indulging in sundry libations for this hour past at
the expense of some of its customers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>is</i> a dream, then&mdash;not a hideous
reality? Thank God, thank God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s a dream?&quot; said Verges, looking
with some apprehension at John. When he saw that gentleman begin to
caper round the room his fears were not lessened, for he thought that
John had taken leave of some of his senses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I awake now, Verges?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you look like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are certain?&quot; and he put a shilling
into Verges&#39; hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never knew you to be more waker.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
You can keep on being as wide-awake as you please at the same price,
Mister!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me my hat and coat, Verges. Thank
you,&quot; and John passed rapidly out at the door with a hasty
&quot;Good night!&quot; Verges looked after him with wide-mouthed
astonishment; then he looked at the piece of money in his hand; then he
tapped his forehead, and shook his head ominously, muttering,
&quot;Daubs is daft&mdash;clean daft!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John would not trust his waking senses till he reached
the corner of the street at which he had seen so vividly in his dream
the incidents just recorded. A solitary policeman was walking up and
down, and not so much as a vehicle was to be seen. And then another fear
took possession of John. Was his dream a presentiment of danger, and had
an accident befallen Willie in some other form?</p>

<p class="indent">He soon reached his lodgings, hurried up the
staircase, and listened fearfully outside the widow&#39;s door. Nobody
seemed astir, but he could see that a light was burning within. Should
he knock? What right had he, a perfect stranger, to intrude at this
unreasonable hour? He remembered, too, his bitter thoughts and words
about the widow and her children&mdash;her &quot;brats!&quot; So he
mounted reluctantly to his apartments. How the silence&mdash;previously
so much desired&mdash;oppressed him! He would eagerly have welcomed at
that moment a cry, a sob, or any sound of life from the room below. But
the sufferer gave no token, and John, in turn, became the sufferer in
the worst form of suffering&mdash;that of mental anguish.</p>

<p class="indent">He could stand it no longer. John determined, at any
cost, to see whether or not Willie had returned in safety. So he
descended, and knocked at Mrs. Maxwell&#39;s door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in,&quot; said a quiet voice, and John
opened the door. The first thing that met his gaze was his picture of
the angel hanging at the head of a child&#39;s cot. Beneath it, calmly
asleep, was Dodo&mdash;Willie&#39;s sister. A frail morsel of humanity
she seemed, with pale, almost transparent, complexion&mdash;the paler by
its contrasting framework of golden hair. Mrs. Maxwell was busily
engaged at needlework. She hastily rose when she saw her visitor.
&quot;I thought it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
was Mrs. Baker&quot; (Mrs. Baker was the landlady), she said. &quot;She
usually looks in the last thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me for intruding, but I was anxious to
know whether your son had arrived here in safety?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, oh yes; some time since. Are you the
gentleman who gave him the angel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said John, simply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you so much; you have made my little girl
so happy. Children have strange fancies in sickness, and she has been
talking about nothing but angels for days past. See,&quot; pointing to
the sleeping child, &quot;it is the first night she has slept soundly
for a whole week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The holiest feeling John had ever experienced since he
knelt as a child at his mother&#39;s knee passed over him. He had never
before felt so thoroughly that a good action was its own reward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I crave one great favour as a return for so
trivial a service? Will you let me see your son?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The widow immediately arose, took a lamp, and beckoned
John to follow her into the next room. There was little Willie fast
asleep in his cot. His lips, even in his sleep, were wreathed in a happy
smile, and as John bent and reverently kissed them, they murmured
softly: &quot;Mr. Daubs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When John again mounted to his chamber it was with a
light heart. His evil angel&mdash;dissatisfaction&mdash;had gone out of
him, and his good angel&mdash;contentment&mdash;reigned in its
stead.</p>

<p class="indent">From that time forth he shared the widow&#39;s vigils;
he was to her an elder son&mdash;to the children, a loving brother. His
heart, too, expanded in sympathy for his fellows, and under this genial
influence his energies, previously cramped, expanded also. The best
proof I can give of this, if proof be necessary, is that the picture
which he shortly afterwards exhibited, entitled &quot;The Two
Angels,&quot; was the picture of the year, and brought to him the fame
which had previously so persistently evaded him. One of the happiest
moments in his life was when he took Dodo&mdash;now quite
recovered&mdash;and Willie to view his &quot;masterpiece.&quot;</p>

<p class="cap">THE birthday card, as we know it now, can scarcely have
been with us more than fifty or fifty-five years, and there is very
little doubt that the more ancient reminder of St. Valentine&#39;s Day
suggested the idea of putting a verse, appropriate to a birthday, in the
place of the often far-fetched sentiments of February the fourteenth.
Nearly all our later poets have contributed to birthday literature, and
we may presume that the delightful <i>morceaux</i> which came from their
pens were written on a card or sheet of paper, and quietly dispatched to
the recipient. Eliza Cook, Tom Moore, Burns, Cowper, Johnson, Tom Hood,
Charles Lamb, and Mrs. Hemans have given to the world the most beautiful
of thoughts within the limits of a four-line verse. Where is a more
suggestive sentiment&mdash;considered by many the finest of all such
verse&mdash;than that which Pope addressed to Martha Blount?&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">&#39;Tis but the funeral of the former year.</span>

</div>

<p class="indent">Thackeray, too, could write delightful lines. His
daughter&mdash;Mrs. Thackeray-Ritchie&mdash;sent the following to the
writer, written by her father to Miss Lucy Batler in America:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lucy&#39;s Birthday.</span></p>

<p class="indent">To-day our birthday poets are limited&mdash;not in
numbers, for the publishers of cards are inundated with verses&mdash;but
in those of merit. One firm, indeed, during the last twelve or thirteen
years has received no fewer than 150,000 compositions, of which number
only some 5,600 have been found usable; not a very great number, when it
is remembered that something between ten and twelve millions of cards
pass between well-wishers in this country alone every year, and that a
similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
quantity are exported to the United States, India, China, and the
Colonies. From five shillings to two or three guineas represents the
market value of a birthday poem, and the shorter such expressions are,
the greater is their value. But eminent writers of course obtain much
more. Lord Tennyson was once asked to pen a dozen birthday poems of
eight lines each. A thousand guineas were offered for the
stanzas&mdash;but, alas for birthday literature, the great poet declined
to write verse on order, even at the rate of ten guineas a line.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bishops, too, have been approached on the subject,
for verses of a religious tendency are more sought after than any
others; those of the late Frances Ridley Havergal are an instance. But
the worthy bishops frankly admitted that the gift of poetry had not been
allotted to them. The late Bishop of Worcester said: &quot;I have not
poetical talent enough to write short poems.&quot; Dr. King, Bishop of
Lincoln, said: &quot;I am sorry, but I am not a poet.&quot; The Bishops
of Manchester and Liverpool also honestly confessed to being no poets,
whilst Dr. Temple, Bishop of London, said: &quot;I am afraid I should
make a great mistake if at my age I began to write short poems;&quot;
generously adding, &quot;the Bishop of Exeter is a genuine
poet.&quot;</p>

<p class="caption">MISS HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the most popular writer to-day is the lady
whose initials&mdash;H. M. B.&mdash;have been appended to many millions
of cards&mdash;Miss Helen Marion Burnside, of whom we give a portrait.
Miss Burnside was born at Bromley Hall, Middlesex, in 1843, and at
twelve years of age was seized with a severe attack of scarlet fever,
the result of which was that she lost her hearing. A year later she
commenced to write birthday poetry, and her prolific abilities will be
understood, when we mention that she has written, on the average, two
hundred birthday poems yearly ever since. Miss Burnside, too, is clever
with her brush, and before she was nineteen years of age the Royal
Academy accepted one of her pictures of fruit and flowers, and, later, a
couple of portraits in crayons.</p>

<p class="indent">We now turn to the designs for birthday cards&mdash;for though the motto
is the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
consideration, a pretty and fanciful surrounding is by no means to be
despised.</p>

<p class="indent">Royal Academicians really do little in this branch of
art. Though both Mr. Poynter and Mr. Sant have applied their brushes in
this direction, and Sir John Millais has before now signified his
willingness to accept a commission, it is presumed that R.A.&#39;s
prefer not to have their work confined to the narrow limits of a
birthday card. An R.A. could ask a couple of hundred pounds for a
design, and get it. Mr. Alma Tadema, when asked what he would charge to
paint a pair of cards, replied&mdash;£600. Ordinary designs fetch from
three to six guineas, though a distinctly original and novel idea, be it
only in the shape of a score of splashes from the brush, is worth from
ten to fifteen guineas.</p>

<p class="indent">Both the Princess Louise and Princess Beatrice have
done some really artistic work, but their efforts have not been made
public&mdash;save in the instance of the Princess Beatrice, whose
Birthday Book is well known.  Cards designed by Royalty have passed only
between members of the Royal Family. They are very simple and
picturesque, flowers and effective landscapes with mountain scenery
figuring prominently. It is indisputable that women excel in such
designs. Theirs seems to be a light, airy, graceful, and almost
fascinating touch; there appears to be no effort&mdash;they seem only to
play with the brush, though with delightful results. Amongst those
ladies who are just now contributing excellent work might be mentioned
the Baroness Marie Von Beckendorf, a German lady, whose flowers are
delicate and fanciful to a degree. Miss Bertha Maguire is also gifted in
the way of flower-painting, whilst Miss Annie Simpson paints many an
exquisite blossom combined with charming landscape.</p>

<p class="indent">The illustrations we give show a page of what have now
become ancient cards, and another of the very latest modern styles.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
It will at once be seen how the birthday card has grown out of the
valentine. The two designs in the top corner of the first are
essentially of a fourteenth of February tendency. Note the tiny god of
love, that irrepressible mite of mischief, Cupid, playing with a garland
of roses; and there, too, is the heart, a trifle too symmetrical to be
natural, with the customary arrow, almost as big as young Cupid himself,
cruelly thrust through the very middle of it. The centre card is a
French design, embossed round the edges with lace paper, with a silken
cross and hand-painted passion flowers laid on the card proper, which is
of rice-paper. The remaining specimen is exceedingly quaint in the
original, and has passed through more than forty birthdays. It is almost
funereal in appearance, as indeed were most of those made at that
period; indeed, many of the specimens of old-time birthday cards we have
examined are made up of weeping willows, young women shedding copious
tears into huge urns at their feet, and what, to all appearance, is a
mausoleum in the distance. And above all is written, &quot;Many happy
returns of the day!&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">

<p class="caption">NEW STYLE.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The other set of cards, the modern ones, are all
suggestive of the good wishes they carry with them. Many of them are of
satin with real lace, delicately hand-painted marguerites, pansies, and
apple-blossoms, whilst the elaborate fan, with its flowing ribbons, is
edged with white swan&#39;s-down and gaily decorated with artificial
corn and poppies. These are from designs kindly placed at our disposal
by Messrs. Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons. The printing of the cards is in
itself an art. One of the largest printing establishments in the world
devoted to this purpose is that of Messrs. Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons, in
Germany, whence comes the greater portion of those required for the
English market. In the little village of Rendnitz, just outside Leipsic,
from a thousand to twelve hundred people find employment. Here may be
found a room containing no fewer than thirty-two of the largest presses,
on which colour-lithography is being printed. Every machine does its own
work, and the amount of labour required on a single birthday card is
such that many cards pass through eighteen or twenty different stages of
printing, and in some exceptionally elaborate instances the number has
run up to thirty-seven.</p>

<p class="indent">The cards are printed on great sheets of board, and
from a thousand to fifteen hundred such sheets, so far as one colouring
is concerned, constitute a good day&#39;s work. These sheets measure 29
inches by 30 inches, and when the various colours are complete, they are
cut up by machinery into some twenty or more pieces, according to the
size of the card. Nor is the printing of birthday cards confined to
cardboard. Effective work has been of late years produced on satin,
celluloid, and Japanese paper; and prices range from as low as twopence
half-penny a gross to as much as seven and eight guineas for each card.
The production of a birthday card, from the time it is designed to the
time when it is laid before the public, generally occupies from eight to
nine months.</p>

<i>The Architect&#39;s Wife.</i></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">From the Spanish of Antonio Trueba.</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">[<span class="smcap">Antonio Trueba</span>, who is
still alive, was born on Christmas Eve, 1821, at Sopuerta, in Spain. As
in the case of Burns, his father was a peasant, and Antonio, as a child,
played in the gutters with the other village urchins, or worked with his
father in the fields. But at fifteen, one of his relations, who kept a
shop at Madrid, made him his assistant. By day he waited on the
customers; by night he studied in his room. Genius like that of Burns
and of Trueba cannot be kept down. Like Burns, the boy began to put
forth songs, strong, sweet, and simple, which stirred the people&#39;s
hearts like music, and soon were hummed in every village street. His
fame spread; it reached the Court; and Queen Isabella bestowed upon him

<p class="cap">TOWARDS the middle of the fourteenth century, Toledo
was laid under siege by Don Enrique de Trastamara; but the city,
faithful to the King surnamed &quot;the Cruel,&quot; offered a brave and
obstinate resistance.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Often had the loyal and valiant Toledans crossed the
magnificent bridge of San Martin&mdash;one of the structures of greatest
beauty of that city of splendid erections&mdash;and had cast themselves
on the encampment of Don Enrique, which was pitched on the Cigarrales,
causing sad havoc to the besieging army.</p>

<p class="indent">In order to prevent the repetition of these attacks,
Don Enrique resolved upon destroying the bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">The Cigarrales, upon which the army was encamped, were
beautiful lands enclosing luxuriant orchards, pleasure gardens, and
summer residences. The fame of their beauty had inspired Tirso and many
Spanish poets to sing its praises.</p>

<p class="indent">One night the luxuriant trees were cut down by the
soldiers of Don Enrique, and heaped upon the bridge. At day-dawn an
immense fire raged on the bridge of San Martin, which assumed huge
proportions, its sinister gleams lighting up the devastating hordes, the
flowing current of the Tagus, the Palace of Don Rodrigo, and the little
Arab Tower. The crackling of the strong and massive pillars, worked with
all the exquisite skill of the artificers who created the marvels of the
Alhambra, sounded like the piteous cry of Art oppressed by
barbarism.</p>

<p class="indent">The Toledans, awakened by this terrible spectacle, ran
to save the beautiful erection from the utter ruin which menaced it, but
all their efforts were unavailing. A tremendous crash, which resounded
throughout the creeks and valleys watered by the Tagus, told them that
the bridge no longer existed.</p>

<p class="indent">Alas! it was too true!</p>

<p class="indent">When the rising sun gilded the cupolas of the Imperial
City, the Toledan maidens who came down to the river to fill their
pitchers from the pure and crystal stream, returned sorrowfully with
empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
pitchers on their heads; the clear waters had become turbid and muddy,
for the roaring waves were carrying down the still smoking ruins of the
bridge.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;MAIDENS RETURNED SORROWFULLY WITH EMPTY PITCHERS.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Popular indignation rose to its highest pitch, and
overflowed all limits; for the bridge of San Martin was the only path
that led to the lovely Cigarrales.</p>

<p class="indent">Joining their forces for one supreme effort, the
Toledans made a furious onslaught on the camp, and, after blood had
flowed in torrents, compelled the army to take flight.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="indent">Many years passed since the bridge of San Martin had
been destroyed.</p>

<p class="indent">Kings and Archbishops had projected schemes to replace
it by another structure, of equal strength and beauty; but the genius
and perseverance of the most famous architects were unable to carry out
their wishes. The rapid, powerful currents of the river destroyed and
swept away the scaffolding and framework before the gigantic arches
could be completed.</p>

<p class="indent">Don Pedro Tenorio, Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, to
whom the city owes her glory almost as much as to her Kings, sent criers
throughout the cities and towns of Spain, inviting architects, Christian
and Moorish, to undertake the reconstruction of the bridge of San
Martin; but with no result. The difficulties to be encountered were
judged insurmountable.</p>

<p class="indent">At length one day a man and a woman, complete
strangers to the place, entered Toledo through the Cambron Gate. They
carefully inspected the ruined bridge. Then they engaged a small house
near the ruins, and proceeded to take up their quarters there.</p>

<p class="indent">On the following day the man proceeded to the
Archbishop&#39;s Palace.</p>

<p class="indent">His Eminence was holding a conference of prelates,
learned men, and distinguished knights, who were attracted by his piety
and wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">Great was his joy when one of his attendants announced
that an architect from distant lands solicited the honour of an
audience.</p>

<p class="indent">The Cardinal Archbishop hastened to receive the
stranger. The first salutations over, his Eminence bade him be
seated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Lord Archbishop,&quot; began the stranger,
&quot;my name, which is unknown to your Eminence, is Juan de Arèvalo,
and I am an architect by profession.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you come in answer to the invitation I have
issued calling upon skilful architects to come and rebuild the bridge of
San Martin, which in former times afforded a passage between the city
and the Cigarrales?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was indeed that invitation which brought me
to Toledo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you aware of the difficulties of its
construction?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am well aware of them. But I can surmount
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you study architecture?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In Salamanca.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what erection have you to show me as a proof
of your skill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None whatever, my lord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Archbishop made a gesture of impatience and
distrust which was noticed by the stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was a soldier in my youth,&quot; continued he,
&quot;but ill-health compelled me to leave the ardous profession of arms
and return to Castille, the land of my birth, where I dedicated myself
to the study of architecture, theoretical and practical.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I regret,&quot; replied the Archbishop,
&quot;that you are unable to mention any work of skill that you have
carried out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are some erections on the Tormes and the
Duero of which others have the credit, but which ought to honour him who
now addresses you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was poor and obscure,&quot; rejoined Juan de
Arèvalo, &quot;and I sought only to earn bread and shelter. Glory I left
to others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I deeply regret,&quot; replied Don Pedro
Tenorio, &quot;that you have no means of assuring us that we should not
trust in you in vain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My lord, I can offer you one guarantee which I
trust will satisfy your Eminence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My life!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Explain yourself.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;">
<img src="images/Scan250.jpg" width="536" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;EXPLAIN YOURSELF.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;When the framework of the centre arch shall be
removed, I, the architect, will stand upon the keystone. Should the
bridge fall, I shall perish with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I accept the guarantee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My lord, trust me, and I will carry out the
work!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Archbishop pressed the hand of the architect, and
Juan de Arèvalo departed, his heart full of joyous expectation. His wife
was anxiously awaiting his return. She was young and handsome still,
despite the ravages of want and suffering.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
&quot;Catherine! my Catherine!&quot; cried the architect, clasping his
wife to his arms, &quot;amid the monuments that embellish Toledo there
will be one to transmit to posterity the name of Juan de
Arèvalo!&quot;</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="indent">Time passed. No longer could the Toledans say, on
approaching the Tagus across the rugged cliffs and solitary places where
in former times stood the Garden of Florinda, &quot;Here once stood the
bridge of San Martin.&quot; Though the new bridge was still supported by
solid scaffolding and massive frames, yet the centre arch already rose
to view, and the whole was firmly planted on the ruins of the
former.</p>

<p class="indent">The Archbishop, Don Pedro Tenorio, and the Toledans
were heaping gifts and praises on the fortunate architect whose skill
had joined the central arch, despite the furious power of the surging
currents, and who had completed the gigantic work with consummate
daring.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the eve of the feast of San Ildefonso, the
patron saint of the city of Toledo. Juan de Arèvalo respectfully
informed the Cardinal Archbishop that nothing was now wanting to
conclude the work, but to remove the woodwork of the arches and the
scaffolding. The joy of the Cardinal and of the people was great. The
removal of the scaffolding and frames which supported the masonry was a
work attended with considerable danger; but the calmness and confidence
of the architect who had pledged himself to stand on the keystone and
await the consequences of success or lose his life, inspired all with
perfect trust.</p>

<p class="indent">The solemn blessing and inauguration of the bridge of
San Martin was fixed to take place on the day following, and the bells
of all the churches of Toledo were joyously ringing in announcement of
the grand event appointed for the morrow. The Toledans contemplated with
rejoicing from the heights above the Tagus the lovely Cigarrales, which
for many years had remained solitary and silent&mdash;indeed, almost
abandoned&mdash;but which on the day following would be restored to
life.</p>

<p class="indent">Towards nightfall Juan de Arèvalo mounted the central
arch to see that all was ready for the opening ceremony. He went humming
to himself as he inspected all the works and preparations. But,
suddenly, an expression of misgiving overspread his countenance. A
thought had struck him&mdash;a thought that froze his blood. He
descended from the bridge and hastened home.</p>

<p class="indent">At the door his wife received him with a joyous smile
and a merry word of congratulation. But on beholding his troubled face
she turned deadly pale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; she cried, affrighted,
&quot;are you ill, dear Juan?&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 508px;">
<img src="images/Scan251.jpg" width="508" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;ARE YOU ILL, DEAR JUAN?&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, dear wife,&quot; he replied, striving to
master his emotion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
&quot;Do not deceive me! your face tells me that something ails
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! the evening is cold and the work has been
excessive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in and sit down at the hearth and I will
get the supper ready, and when you have had something to eat and are
rested you will be at ease again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At ease!&quot; murmured Juan to himself, in
agony of spirit, whilst his wife busied herself in the preparation of
the supper, placing the table close to the hearth, upon which she threw
a faggot.</p>

<p class="indent">Juan made a supreme effort to overcome his sadness,
but it was futile. His wife could not be deceived.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the first time in our married life,&quot;
she said, &quot;you hide a sorrow from me. Am I no longer worthy of your
love and confidence?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Catherine!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;do not, for
heaven&#39;s sake, grieve me further by doubting my affection for
you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where there is no trust,&quot; she rejoined in
feeling tones, &quot;there can be no true love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then respect, for your own good and mine, the
secret I conceal from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your secret is a sorrow, and I wish to know it
and to lighten it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To lighten it? That is impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To such a love as mine,&quot; she urged,
&quot;nothing is impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well: then hear me. To-morrow my life and
honour will be lost. The bridge must fall into the river, and I on the
keystone shall perish with the fabric which, with so much anxiety and so
many hopes, I have erected!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no!&quot; cried Catherine, as she clasped
her husband in her arms with loving tenderness, smothering in her own
heart the anguish of the revelation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dear wife! When I was most confident of my
triumph, I discovered that, owing to an error in my calculations, the
bridge must fall to-morrow when the framework is removed. And with it
perishes the architect who projected and directed it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bridge may sink into the waters, but not
you, my loved one. On bended knees I will beseech the noble Cardinal to
release you from your terrible engagement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What you ask will be in vain. Even should the
Cardinal accede to your entreaty, I refuse life destitute of
honour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall have life and honour both, dear
husband,&quot; replied Catherine.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p class="indent">It was midnight. Juan, worn out with grief and anxious
work, at last had fallen asleep; a feverish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
sleep that partook more of the character of a nightmare than of
Nature&#39;s sweet restorer.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile his wife had for some time made a show of
sleeping. But she watched her husband anxiously. When she felt certain
that he had at length succumbed to a deep sleep, she softly rose, and
scarcely daring to breathe, crept out into the kitchen. She opened the
window gently and looked out.</p>

<p class="indent">The night was dark; now and again vivid flashes of
lightning lit up the sky. No sound was heard save the roar of the
rushing currents of the Tagus, and the sighing of the wind as it swept
in and out among the scaffolding and complicated framework of the
bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">Catherine noiselessly closed the window. From the
hearth she took one of the half-burnt faggots which still smouldered,
and throwing a cloak over her shoulders went out into the silent
streets, her heart beating wildly.</p>

<p class="indent">Where was she proceeding? Was she carrying that
burning faggot as a torch to light her path in the dense darkness of a
moonless night? It was indeed a dangerous track, covered as it was with
broken boulders, and uneven ground. Yet she strove rather to conceal the
lighted wood beneath her cloak.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she reached the bridge. The wind still sighed
and whistled, and the river continued to break its current against the
pillars, as though irritated at meeting obstacles which it could no
longer sweep away.</p>

<p class="indent">Catherine approached the buttress of the bridge. An
involuntary shudder of terror passed through her frame. Was it because
she stood on the edge of that abyss of roaring waters? Or was it because
her hand, only accustomed hitherto to deeds of goodness, was now
brandishing the torch of destruction? Or rather did she tremble because
a tremendous peal of thunder at that moment resounded through the vault
of heaven.</p>

<p class="indent">Waving the torch to kindle it afresh, she applied it
to the dry, resinous wood of the scaffolding. The wood quickly ignited,
and the flame, fanned by the wind, ascended with fearful rapidity,
spreading and involving arches and framework and the whole structure of
the bridge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;">
<img src="images/Scan252.jpg" width="464" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;THE FLAME ASCENDED WITH FEARFUL RAPIDITY.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then she quitted the scene swiftly. Aided by the glare
of the conflagration and the vivid flashes of lightning which lit up the
sky, Catherine soon traversed the space which separated her from her
home. She entered as noiselessly as she had left it, and closed the
door. Her husband still slept soundly, and had not missed her. Catherine
again pretended to be fast asleep, as though she had never left her
bed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
A few moments later, a noise of many people running arose within the
city, while from every belfry the bells rang forth the terrible alarm of
fire. A tremendous crash succeeded, followed by a cry of anguish such as
had been uttered years before, when the besieging army wrecked the
former bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">Juan awoke in terror; Catherine lay at his side,
apparently sleeping calmly. He dressed himself in haste, and ran out to
learn the reason of the uproar. To his secret joy he beheld the ruin of
the burning bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">The Cardinal Archbishop and the Toledans attributed
the disaster to a flash of lightning which had struck the central arch,
and had, moreover, ignited the whole structure. The general sorrow was
intense. Great also was the public sympathy with the despair which the
calamity must have caused the architect, who was on the eve of a great
triumph. The inhabitants never knew whether it was fire from heaven, or
an accident that had caused the conflagration; but Juan de Arèvalo, who
was good and pious, and firmly believed in the protection of heaven,
never wavered for an instant in the belief that the bridge had really
been destroyed by lightning.</p>

<p class="indent">The destruction of the bridge, however, only retarded
Juan&#39;s triumph for a twelve-month. On the following year, on the
same festival of San Ildefonso, his new bridge was solemnly thrown open
by the Cardinal; and the joyous Toledans once more crossed the Tagus to
visit the lovely grounds of the Cigarrales, which they had been deprived
of for so many years. On that auspicious day the Cardinal celebrated the
event by giving a magnificent banquet. At his right hand sat the
architect and his noble wife; and after a highly complimentary speech
from the Cardinal, the whole company, amidst a tumult of applause,
conducted Juan and Catherine to their home.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;AT HIS RIGHT HAND SAT THE ARCHITECT AND HIS NOBLE WIFE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Five hundred years have passed since then, but
Juan&#39;s bridge still stands secure above the rushing waters of the
Tagus. His second calculation had no error. The following illustration
shows its appearance at the present day.</p>

<i>On the Decay of Humour in the House of Commons.</i></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Henry W. Lucy</span> (&quot;<span class="smcap">Toby</span>, M.P.&quot;).</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Scan254-1.jpg" alt="T" width="115" height="115" class="cap" />
<p class="cap">THERE is no doubt&mdash;it is not feigned by tired
fancy&mdash;that the present House of Commons is a less entertaining
assembly than it was wont to be. This is partly due to the lack of
heaven-born comedians and largely to the curtailment of opportunity. The
alteration of the rules of time under which the House sits for work was
fatal to redundancy of humour. The House of Commons is, after all,
human, and it is an indisputable fact that mankind is more disposed to
mirth after dinner than before. If the record be searched it will be
found that ninety per cent. of the famous scenes that have established
its reputation as a place of public entertainment have happened after
dinner.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Under the new rules, which practically close debate at
midnight, there is no &quot;after dinner.&quot; Mechanically, apparently
involuntarily, the old arrangement of debate has shifted. Time was,
within the memory of many sitting in the present House, when the climax
of debate was found in its closing hours. The Leader of the House rose
at eleven or half-past, and before a crowded and excited assembly
cheered on his followers to an impending division. When he sat down,
amid thundering cheers from his supporters, the Leader of the Opposition
sprang to his feet, was hailed with a wild cheer from his friends,
struck ringing blows across the table, and then, at one o&#39;clock, or
two o&#39;clock, or whatever hour of the morning it might chance to be,
members poured forth in tumultuous tide, parting at the division
lobby.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/Scan254-2.jpg" width="226" height="351" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;ADMIRABLY-FEIGNED SURPRISE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">This was the period of the evening when chartered
libertines of debate appeared on the scene and the fun grew fast and
furious. It was Mr. O&#39;Donnell&#39;s pleasing habit to rise when the
duel between the Leaders was concluded, and the crowded House roared for
the division like caged lions whose feeding-time is overstepped. Pausing
to recapture his errant eyeglass, Mr. O&#39;Donnell was accustomed to
gaze round the seething mass of senators with admirably-feigned surprise
at their impatience. When the uproar lulled he began his speech; when it
rose again he stopped; but the speech was inevitable, and members
presently recognising the position, sat in sullen silence till he had
said his say.</p>

<p class="indent">This was comedy, not highly conceived it is true, but
worked out with great skill, the enraged House chiefly contributing to
its success. It was varied by the tragedy of the desperate English or
Scotch member who, striving vainly night after night to catch the
Speaker&#39;s eye, made a mad plunge at his last chance, and was
literally howled down. It was a favourite hour for the late Mr.
Biggar&#39;s manifestations, and the lamented and immortal Major
O&#39;Gorman never failed to put in an appearance at eleven o&#39;clock,
ready for any fun that might be going or might be made.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, when members slowly fill the House after dinner,
dropping in between ten and eleven o&#39;clock, they know there is no
time for anything but business. If a division is imminent the debate
must necessarily stop before midnight for the question to be put. If it
is to be continued, it must be adjourned sharp on the stroke of
midnight. As the House rarely refills much before eleven o&#39;clock,
there is not opportunity after dinner for more than one set speech from
a favourite orator. The consequence is that the plums of debate are in
these days all pulled out before dinner; and though at this period, the
withers of the House being unwrung it is ready for a brisk fight, it is
not in the mellow mood that invites and encourages the humorous.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;ELOQUENCE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Whilst the opportunities of the Parliamentary Yorick
are thus peremptorily curtailed, he is at a further disadvantage in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
view of the personality of the Leadership. It is impossible that a House
led by Mr. W. H. Smith can be as prone to merriment as was one which
found its head in Mr. Disraeli. When, in the Parliament of 1868, Mr.
Gladstone was Premier and Mr. Disraeli Leader of the Opposition, or in
the succeeding Parliament, when these positions were reversed, the House
of Commons enjoyed a unique incentive to conditions of humour. Mr.
Gladstone, with his gravity of mien, his sonorous sustained eloquence,
and his seriousness about trifles, was a superb foil for the gay, but
always mordant humour of Mr. Disraeli.</p>

<p class="indent">From the outset of his career that great
Parliamentarian enjoyed extraordinary advantage by reason of the
accident of the personality against which, first and last, he was
pitted. Having had Sir Robert Peel to gird against through the space of
a dozen years, it was too much to hope that for fully a quarter of a
century he should have enjoyed the crowning mercy of being opposed to
and contrasted with Mr. Gladstone. Yet such was his good fortune. How
little he did with Lord Hartington in the interregnum of 1874-7, and how
little mark he made against Lord Granville when he met him in the Lords,
brings into strong light the advantage fortune had secured for him
through the longer period of his life.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/Scan255-2.jpg" width="359" height="335" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;HAUNTED.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Whilst the tone and habit of the House of Commons in
matters of humour are to a considerable extent conformable with the
idiosyncrasy of its leaders, it will sometimes, in despair of prevailing
dulness, assume a joke if it has it not. There is nothing more
delightful in the happiest efforts of Mr. Disraeli than the peculiar
relations which subsist between the present House of Commons and Mr. W.
H. Smith. On one side we have a good, amiable, somewhat pedagogic
gentleman, unexpectedly thrust into the seat haunted by the shades of
Palmerston and Disraeli. On the other side is the House of Commons, a
little doubtful of the result, but personally liking the new Leader, and
constitutionally prone to recognise authority.</p>

<p class="indent">At first Mr. Smith was voted unbearably dull. His
hesitating manner, his painful self-consciousness, his moral
reflections, and his all-pervading sense of &quot;duty to his Queen and
country&quot; bored the House. In the first few months of his succession
to Lord Randolph Churchill, there was seen the unwonted spectacle of
members getting up and leaving the House when the Leader presented
himself at the table. But Mr. Smith plodded on, patiently, pathetically,
trolling out his moral reflections, and tremulously preserving what with
full consciousness of the contradiction of words may be described as an
air of submissive authority. Members began to perceive, or perhaps to
invent, the fun of the thing. Mr. Smith realised their boyhood&#39;s
idea of Mr. Barlow conversing with his pupils; only he was always
benevolent, and though he frequently shook his ferule with threatening
gesture, Sandford and Merton felt that the palms of their hands were
safe.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;THREE-FOURTHS OF A PARTY.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Mr. Smith is, however, peculiarly a House of
Commons&#39; possession. No one out of the House can quite understand
how precious he is, how inimitable, how indescribable. To the outsider
he makes poor amends for the Irish Members of the Parliament of 1874, or
the Fourth Party that played so prominent a <i>rôle</i> in the House
that met in 1880. The Fourth Party, like the Major, Mr. Biggar, Mr.
Delahunty, Mr. McCarthy Downing, and the famous Lord Mayor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
Dublin&mdash;who warned Mr. Forster what would happen in the event of an
(absolutely uncontemplated) attempt on the part of the Chief Secretary
to drag his lordship&#39;s spouse out of her bed in the dead of the
night&mdash;are with us no more. Gone too, faded into dreamland, are the
characters who made up the Fourth Party. Happily three of them remain
with us, though in strangely altered circumstances. Two sit on the
Treasury Bench, and one watches it from behind with friendly concern
that adds a new terror to Ministerial office.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;HE WRITHES.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Each in his way brilliantly sustains the reputation of
the famous school in which he was trained. There is in the House only
one possibly superior combination of debaters to Lord Randolph
Churchill, Mr. Arthur Balfour, and Sir John Gorst. In the quality of
humour especially under consideration, this combination carries away the
palm from the other. I think it is untrue to say, as is commonly
accepted, that Mr. Gladstone is devoid of the sense of humour, though it
must be admitted that it does not predominate in his House of Commons
speeches. Mr. Chamberlain is even more conspicuously lacking in this
commanding quality. On the other hand, Mr. Balfour in his House of
Commons addresses does not shine as a humorist. He is in his public
character (in strange contrast, by the way, with his personal habitude)
not sufficiently genial. But he has a pretty wit of the sarcastic,
poisoned-dagger style, which, differing from the effects of humour,
makes everybody laugh, save the object of the attack. <i>He</i>
writhes.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Balfour&#39;s Parliamentary style, doubtless
unconsciously, perhaps for reasons connected with heredity, is shaped
upon his distinguished uncle&#39;s. He lacks the grave ponderosity which
gives the finishing touch to Lord Salisbury&#39;s occasional trifling
with public questions. But he is still young, and his style
inchoate.</p>

<p class="indent">The Minister who answers for India in the House of
Commons cannot fairly be expected to contribute to the hilarity of its
proceedings. Yet occasionally Sir John Gorst, more particularly at
question-time, standing at the table with almost funereal aspect, drops
a parenthetical remark that convulses the House with laughter. Lord
Randolph Churchill, since he has taken to racing, has assumed a gravity
of manner which militates against repetition of his old successes in
setting the table in a roar.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;AN IMPASSIONED ORATORICAL FIST.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">But the gloom under which he has enveloped himself is,
like that which just now obscures the sunlight of laughter over the
House generally, only a temporary condition. The present House has
accidentally run into a groove of gloom, which will probably outlast its
existence. But there is no reason to believe that the decay of humour
noted will be permanent. There is no assembly in the world so
pathetically eager to be amused as is the House of Commons. It sits and
listens entranced to bursts of sustained argument. It follows with keen
intellectual delight the course of subtle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
argument. It burns with fierce indignation at a story of wrong-doing. It
flashes with generous impulse at an invitation to do right. But it
likes, above all things, to be made to laugh. In its despair of worthier
efforts, almost anything will do. An agitated orator rounding off his
peroration by sitting down on his hat; a glass of water upset; or,
primest joke of all, an impassioned oratorical fist brought down with
resonant thud on the hat of a listener sitting attentive on the bench
below&mdash;these are trivial, familiar accidents that never fail to
bring down the House.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;A PRIME FAVOURITE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">So persistently eager is the House to be amused that,
failing the gift of beneficent nature, it will, as in the case of Mr. W.
H. Smith, invent a humorous aspect of a man, and laugh at its own
creation. There are many cases where a man has commenced his
Parliamentary career amidst evidences not only of personal disfavour,
but of almost malignant animosity, and has finished by finding his
interposition in debate hailed by hilarious cheering. Such a case was
that of the late Mr. Biggar, who for fully ten years of his
Parliamentary career was an object of unbridled execration. He lived to
find himself almost a prime favourite in the House, a man who, when he
had not got further in his speech than to ejaculate &quot;Mr. Speaker,
sir,&quot; found himself the focus of a circle of beaming faces, keenly
anticipatory of fun. Mr. Biggar in the sessions of 1886-9 was the same
member for Cavan who, in the Parliament of 1874, was a constant mark of
contumely, and even of personal hatred. The House had grown used to him,
and had gradually built up round his name and personality an ideal of
eccentric humour. But the creative power was with the audience&mdash;a
priceless quality that remains with it even in these dull times, and
though temporarily subdued, will presently have its day again.</p>

<p class="cap">TOWARDS the end of 1811, at a memorable period for
Russians, lived on his own domain of Nenaradova the kind-hearted Gavril
R. He was celebrated in the whole district for his hospitality and his
genial character. Neighbours constantly visited him to have something to
eat and drink, and to play at five-copeck boston with his wife,
Praskovia. Some, too, went to have a look at their daughter, Maria; a
tall pale girl of seventeen. She was an heiress, and they desired her
either for themselves or for their sons.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Maria had been brought up on French novels, and
consequently was in love. The object of her affection was a poor ensign
in the army, who was now at home in his small village on leave of
absence. As a matter of course, the young man reciprocated Maria&#39;s
passion. But the parents of his beloved, noticing their mutual
attachment, forbade their daughter even to think of him, while they
received him worse than an ex-assize judge.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;THE LOVERS MET IN THE PINE WOOD.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Our lovers corresponded, and met alone daily in the
pine wood or by the old roadway chapel. There they vowed everlasting
love, inveighed against fate, and exchanged various suggestions. Writing
and talking in this way, they quite naturally reached the following
conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">If we cannot exist apart from each other, and if the
tyranny of hard-hearted parents throws obstacles in the way of our
happiness, then can we not manage without them?</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, this happy idea originated in the mind of
the young man; but it pleased immensely the romantic imagination of
Maria.</p>

<p class="indent">Winter set in, and put a stop to their meetings. But
their correspondence became all the more active. Vladimir begged Maria
in every letter to give herself up to him that they might get married
secretly, hide for a while, and then throw themselves at the feet of
their parents, who would of course in the end be touched by their heroic
constancy and say to them, &quot;Children, come to our arms!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maria hesitated a long while, and out of many
different plans proposed, that of flight was for a time rejected. At
last, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
she consented. On the appointed day she was to decline supper, and
retire to her room under the plea of a headache. She and her maid, who
was in the secret, were then to go out into the garden by the back
stairs, and beyond the garden they would find a sledge ready for them,
would get into it and drive a distance of five miles from Nenaradova, to
the village of Jadrino, straight to the church, where Vladimir would be
waiting for them.</p>

<p class="indent">On the eve of the decisive day, Maria did not sleep
all night; she was packing and tying up linen and dresses. She wrote,
moreover, a long letter to a friend of hers, a sentimental young lady;
and another to her parents. Of the latter, she took leave in the most
touching terms. She excused the step she was taking by reason of the
unconquerable power of love, and wound up by declaring that she should
consider it the happiest moment of her life when she was allowed to
throw herself at the feet of her dearest parents. Sealing both letters
with a Toula seal, on which were engraven two flaming hearts with an
appropriate inscription, she at last threw herself upon her bed before
daybreak, and dosed off, though even then she was awakened from one
moment to another by terrible thoughts. First it seemed to her that at
the moment of entering the sledge in order to go and get married, her
father stopped her, and with cruel rapidity dragged her over the snow,
and threw her into a dark bottomless cellar&mdash;down which she fell
headlong with an indescribable sinking of the heart. Then she saw
Vladimir, lying on the grass, pale and bleeding; with his dying breath
he implored her to make haste and marry him. Other hideous and senseless
visions floated before her one after another. Finally, she rose paler
than usual, and with a real headache.</p>

<p class="indent">Both her father and her mother remarked her
indisposition. Their tender anxiety and constant inquiries, &quot;What
is the matter with you, Masha&mdash;are you ill?&quot; cut her to the
heart. She tried to pacify them and to appear cheerful; but she could
not. Evening set in. The idea that she was passing the day for the last
time in the midst of her family oppressed her. In her secret heart she
took leave of everybody, of everything which surrounded her.</p>

<p class="indent">Supper was served; her heart beat violently. In a
trembling voice she declared that she did not want any supper, and
wished her father and mother goodnight. They kissed her, and as usual
blessed her; and she nearly wept.</p>

<p class="indent">Reaching her own room, she threw herself into an easy
chair and burst into tears. Her maid begged her to be calm and take
courage. Everything was ready. In half an hour Masha would leave for
ever her parents&#39; house, her own room, her peaceful life as a young
girl.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 466px;">
<img src="images/Scan259.jpg" width="466" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;SHE BURST INTO TEARS.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Out of doors the snow was falling, the wind howling.
The shutters rattled and shook. In everything she seemed to recognise
omens and threats.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon the whole home was quiet and asleep. Masha
wrapped herself in a shawl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
put on a warm cloak, and with a box in her hand, passed out on to the
back staircase. The maid carried two bundles after her. They descended
into the garden. The snowstorm raged; a strong wind blew against them,
as if trying to stop the young culprit. With difficulty they reached the
end of the garden. In the road a sledge awaited them.</p>

<p class="indent">The horses, from cold, would not stand still.
Vladimir&#39;s coachman was walking to and fro in front of them, trying
to quiet them. He helped the young lady and her maid to their seats, and
packing away the bundles and the dressing-case, took up the reins, and
the horses flew forward into the darkness of the night.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Having entrusted the young lady to the care of fate
and of Tereshka the coachman, let us return to the young lover.</p>

<p class="indent">Vladimir had spent the whole day in driving. In the
morning he had called on the Jadrino priest, and, with difficulty, came
to terms with him. Then he went to seek for witnesses from amongst the
neighbouring gentry. The first on whom he called was a former cornet of
horse, Dravin by name, a man in his forties, who consented at once. The
adventure, he declared, reminded him of old times and of his larks when
he was in the Hussars. He persuaded Vladimir to stop to dinner with him,
assuring him that there would be no difficulty in getting the other two
witnesses. Indeed, immediately after dinner in came the surveyor
Schmidt, with a moustache and spurs, and the son of a
captain-magistrate, a boy of sixteen, who had recently entered the
Uhlans. They not only accepted Vladimir&#39;s proposal, but even swore
that they were ready to sacrifice their lives for him. Vladimir embraced
them with delight, and drove off to get everything ready.</p>

<p class="indent">It had long been dark. Vladimir despatched his
trustworthy Tereshka to Nenaradova with his two-horsed sledge, and with
appropriate instructions for the occasion. For himself he ordered the
small sledge with one horse, and started alone without a coachman for
Jadrino, where Maria ought to arrive in a couple of hours. He knew the
road, and the drive would only occupy twenty minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">But Vladimir had scarcely passed from the enclosure
into the open field when the wind rose, and soon there was a driving
snowstorm so heavy and so severe that he could not see. In a moment the
road was covered with snow. All landmarks disappeared in the murky
yellow darkness, through which fell white flakes of snow. Sky and earth
became merged into one. Vladimir, in the midst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
of the field, tried in vain to get to the road. The horse walked on at
random, and every moment stepped either into deep snow or into a rut, so
that the sledge was constantly upsetting. Vladimir tried at least not to
lose the right direction; but it seemed to him that more than half an
hour had passed, and he had not yet reached the Jadrino wood. Another
ten minutes passed, and still the wood was invisible. Vladimir drove
across fields intersected by deep ditches. The snowstorm did not abate,
and the sky did not clear. The horse was getting tired and the
perspiration rolled from him like hail, in spite of the fact that every
moment his legs were disappearing in the snow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan260.jpg" width="600" height="406" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;ALL LANDMARKS DISAPPEARED.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">At last Vladimir found that he was going in the wrong
direction. He stopped; began to reflect, recollect, and consider; till
at last he became convinced that he ought to have turned to the right.
He did so now. His horse could scarcely drag along. But he had been more
than an hour on the road, and Jadrino could not now be far. He drove and
drove, but there was no getting out of the field. Still snow-drifts and
ditches. Every moment the sledge was upset, and every moment Vladimir
had to raise it up.</p>

<p class="indent">Time was slipping by; and Vladimir grew seriously
anxious. At last in the distance some dark object could be seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Vladimir turned in its direction, and as he drew near
found it was a wood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank Heaven,&quot; he thought, &quot;I am now
near the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drove by the side of the wood, hoping to come at
once upon the familiar road, or, if not, to pass round the wood. Jadrino
was situated immediately behind it.</p>

<p class="indent">He soon found the road, and passed into the darkness
of the wood, now stripped by the winter. The wind could not rage here;
the road was smooth, the horse picked up courage, and Vladimir was
comforted.</p>

<p class="indent">He drove and drove, but still Jadrino was not to be
seen; there was no end to the wood. Then, to his horror, he discovered
that he had got into a strange wood! He was in despair. He whipped his
horse, and the poor animal started off at a trot. But it soon got tired,
and in a quarter of an hour, in spite of all poor Vladimir&#39;s
efforts, could only crawl.</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually the trees became thinner, and Vladimir drove
out of the wood; but Jadrino was not to be seen. It must have been about
midnight. Tears gushed from the young man&#39;s eyes. He drove on at
random; and now the weather abated, the clouds dispersed, and before him
was a wide stretch of plain covered with a white billowy carpet. The
night was comparatively clear, and he could see a small village a short
distance off, which consisted of four or five cottages. Vladimir drove
towards it. At the first door he jumped out of the sledge, ran up to the
window, and tapped.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few minutes a wooden shutter was raised, and
an old man stuck out his grey beard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 521px;">
<img src="images/Scan261.jpg" width="521" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;WHAT DO YOU WANT?&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
&quot;How far is Jadrino?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How far is Jadrino?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes! Is it far?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not far; about ten miles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this answer Vladimir clutched hold of his hair, and
stood motionless, like a man condemned to death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do you come from?&quot; added the man.
Vladimir had not the courage to reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My man,&quot; he said, &quot;can you procure me
horses to Jadrino?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have no horses,&quot; answered the
peasant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could I find a guide? I will pay him any sum he
likes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot; said the old man, dropping the
shutter; &quot;I will send my son out to you; he will conduct
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Vladimir waited. Scarcely a minute had passed when he
again knocked. The shutter was lifted, and a beard was seen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about your son?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;ll come out directly: he is putting on
his boots. Are you cold? Come in and warm yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks; send out your son quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The gate creaked; a youth came out with a cudgel, and
walked on in front, at one time pointing out the road, at another
looking for it in a mass of drifted snow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What o&#39;clock is it?&quot; Vladimir asked
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will soon be daylight,&quot; replied the
young peasant. Vladimir spoke not another word.</p>

<p class="indent">The cocks were crowing, and it was light when they
reached Jadrino. The church was closed. Vladimir paid the guide, and
drove into the yard of the priest&#39;s house. In the yard his
two-horsed sledge was not to be seen. What news awaited him!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">But let us return to the kind proprietors of
Nenaradova, and see what is going on there.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">The old people awoke, and went into the sitting-room,
Gavril in a night-cap and flannel jacket, Praskovia in a wadded dressing
gown. The samovar was brought in, and Gavril sent the little maid to ask
Maria how she was and how she had slept. The little maid returned,
saying that her young lady had slept badly, but that she was better now,
and that she would come into the sitting-room in a moment. And indeed
the door opened and Maria came in and wished her papa and mamma good
morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is your head-ache, Masha?&quot; (familiar
for Mary) inquired Gavril.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better, papa,&quot; answered Masha.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fumes from the stoves must have given you
your headache,&quot; remarked Praskovia.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps so, mamma,&quot; replied Masha.</p>

<p class="indent">The day passed well enough, but in the night Masha was
taken ill. A doctor was sent for from town. He came towards evening and
found the patient delirious. Soon she was in a severe fever, and in a
fortnight the poor patient was on the brink of the grave.</p>

<p class="indent">No member of the family knew anything of the flight
from home. The letters written by Masha the evening before had been
burnt; and the maid, fearing the wrath of the master and mistress, had
not breathed a word. The priest, the ex-cornet, the big moustached
surveyor, and the little lancer were equally discreet, and with good
reason. Tereshka, the coachman, never said too much, not even in his
drink. Thus the secret was kept better than it might have been by half a
dozen conspirators.</p>

<p class="indent">But Maria herself, in the course of her long fever let
out her secret. Nevertheless, her words were so disconnected that her
mother, who never left her bedside, could only make out from them that
her daughter was desperately in love with Vladimir, and that probably
love was the cause of her illness. She consulted her husband and some of
her neighbours, and at last it was decided unanimously that the fate of
Maria ought not to be interfered with, that a woman must not ride away
from the man she is destined to marry, that poverty is no crime, that a
woman has to live not with money but with a man, and so on. Moral
proverbs are wonderfully useful on such occasions, when we can invent
little or nothing in our own justification.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the young lady began to recover. Vladimir
had not been seen for a long time in the house of Gavril, so frightened
had he been by his previous reception. It was now resolved to send and
announce to him the good news which he could scarcely expect: the
consent of her parents to his marriage with Maria.</p>

<p class="indent">But what was the astonishment of the proprietors of
Nenaradova when, in answer to their invitation they received an insane
reply. Vladimir informed them he could never set foot in their house,
and begged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
them to forget an unhappy man whose only hope now was in death. A few
days afterwards they heard that Vladimir had left the place and joined
the army.</p>

<p class="indent">A long time passed before they ventured to tell Masha,
who was now recovering. She never mentioned Vladimir. Some months later,
however, finding his name in the list of those who had distinguished
themselves and been severely wounded at Borodino, she fainted, and it
was feared that the fever might return. But, Heaven be thanked! the
fainting fit had no bad results.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Maria experienced yet another sorrow. Her father died,
leaving her the heiress of all his property. But the inheritance could
not console her. She shared sincerely the affliction of her mother, and
vowed she would never leave her.</p>

<p class="indent">Suitors clustered round the charming heiress; but she
gave no one the slightest hope. Her mother sometimes tried to persuade
her to choose a companion in life; but Maria shook her head, and grew
pensive.</p>

<p class="indent">Vladimir no longer existed. He had died at Moscow on
the eve of the arrival of the French. His memory was held sacred by
Maria, and she treasured up everything that would remind her of him:
books he had read, drawings which he had made; songs he had sung, and
the pieces of poetry which he had copied out for her.</p>

<p class="indent">The neighbours, hearing all this, wondered at her
fidelity, and awaited with curiosity the arrival of the hero who must in
the end triumph over the melancholy constancy of this virgin
Artemis.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, the war had been brought to a glorious
conclusion, and our armies were returning from abroad. The people ran to
meet them. The music played by the regimental bands consisted of war
songs, &quot;Vive Henri-Quatre,&quot; Tirolese waltzes and airs from
Joconde. Nourished on the atmosphere of winter, officers who had started
on the campaign mere striplings, returned grown men, and covered with
decorations. The soldiers conversed gaily among themselves, mingling
German and French words every moment in their speech. A time never to be
forgotten&mdash;a time of glory and delight! How quickly beat the
Russian heart at the words, &quot;Native land!&quot; How sweet the tears
of meeting! With what unanimity did we combine feelings of national
pride with love for the Tsar! And for him, what a moment!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<img src="images/Scan263.jpg" width="516" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;A TIME OF GLORY AND DELIGHT.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The women&mdash;our Russian women&mdash;were splendid
then. Their usual coldness disappeared. Their delight was really
intoxicating when, meeting the conquerors, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
cried, &quot;Hurrah!&quot; And they threw up their caps in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">Who of the officers of that period does not own that
to the Russian women he was indebted for his best and most valued
reward? During this brilliant period Maria was living with her mother in
retirement, and neither of them saw how, in both the capitals, the
returning troops were welcomed. But in the districts and villages the
general enthusiasm was, perhaps, even greater.</p>

<p class="indent">In these places the appearance of an officer became
for him a veritable triumph. The accepted lover in plain clothes fared
badly by his side.</p>

<p class="indent">We have already said that, in spite of her coldness,
Maria was still, as before, surrounded by suitors. But all had to fall
in the rear when there arrived at his castle the wounded young captain
of Hussars&mdash;Bourmin by name&mdash;with the order of St. George in
his button-hole, and an interesting pallor on his face. He was about
twenty-six. He had come home on leave to his estates, which were close
to Maria&#39;s villa. Maria paid him such attention as none of the
others received. In his presence her habitual gloom disappeared. It
could not be said that she flirted with him. But a poet, observing her
behaviour, might have asked, &quot;S&#39;amor non è, che
dunque?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bourmin was really a very agreeable young man. He
possessed just the kind of sense that pleased women: a sense of what is
suitable and becoming. He had no affectation, and was carelessly
satirical. His manner towards Maria was simple and easy. He seemed to be
of a quiet and modest disposition; but rumour said that he had at one
time been terribly wild. This, however, did not harm him in the opinion
of Maria, who (like all other young ladies) excused, with pleasure,
vagaries which were the result of impulsiveness and daring.</p>

<p class="indent">But above all&mdash;more than his love-making, more
than his pleasant talk, more than his interesting pallor, more even than
his bandaged arm&mdash;the silence of the young Hussar excited her
curiosity and her imagination. She could not help confessing to herself
that he pleased her very much. Probably he too, with his acuteness and
his experience, had seen that he interested her. How was it, then, that
up to this moment she had not seen him at her feet; had not received
from him any declaration whatever? And wherefore did she not encourage
him with more attention, and, according to circumstances, even with
tenderness? Had she a secret of her own which would account for her
behaviour?</p>

<p class="indent">At last, Bourmin fell into such deep meditation, and
his black eyes rested with such fire upon Maria, that the decisive
moment seemed very near. The neighbours spoke of the marriage as an
accomplished fact, and kind Praskovia rejoiced that her daughter had at
last found for herself a worthy mate.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady was sitting alone once in the drawing-room,
laying out grande-patience, when Bourmin entered the room, and at once
inquired for Maria.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is in the garden,&quot; replied the old
lady: &quot;go to her, and I will wait for you here.&quot; Bourmin went,
and the old lady made the sign of the cross and thought, &quot;Perhaps
the affair will be settled to-day!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bourmin found Maria in the ivy-bower beside the pond,
with a book in her hands, and wearing a white dress&mdash;a veritable
heroine of romance. After the first inquiries, Maria purposely let the
conversation drop; increasing by these means the mutual embarrassment,
from which it was only possible to escape by means of a sudden and
positive declaration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/Scan265.jpg" width="540" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;IN THE IVY-BOWER.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">It happened thus. Bourmin, feeling the awkwardness of
his position, informed Maria that he had long sought an opportunity of
opening his heart to her, and that he begged for a moment&#39;s
attention. Maria closed the book and lowered her eyes, as a sign that
she was listening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love you,&quot; said Bourmin, &quot;I love you
passionately!&quot; Maria blushed, and bent her head still lower.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have behaved imprudently, yielding as I have
done to the seductive pleasure of seeing and hearing you daily.&quot;
Maria recollected the first letter of St. Preux in &quot;La Nouvelle
Heloise.&quot; &quot;It is too late now to resist my fate. The
remembrance of you, your dear incomparable image, must from to-day be at
once the torment and the consolation of my existence. I have now a grave
duty to perform, a terrible secret to disclose, which will place between
us an insurmountable barrier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has always existed!&quot; interrupted Maria;
&quot;I could never have been your wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; he replied quickly; &quot;I know
that you once loved. But death and three years of mourning may have
worked some change. Dear, kind Maria, do not try to deprive me of my
last consolation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
the idea that you might have consented to make me happy
if&mdash;&mdash;. Don&#39;t speak, for God&#39;s sake don&#39;t
speak&mdash;you torture me. Yes, I know, I feel that you could have been
mine, but&mdash;I am the most miserable of beings&mdash;I am already
married!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maria looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am married,&quot; continued Bourmin; &quot;I
have been married more than three years, and do not know who my wife is,
or where she is, or whether I shall ever see her again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you saying?&quot; exclaimed Maria;
&quot;how strange! Pray continue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the beginning of 1812,&quot; said Bourmin,
&quot;I was hurrying on to Wilna, where my regiment was stationed.
Arriving one evening late at a station, I ordered the horses to be got
ready quickly, when suddenly a fearful snowstorm broke out. Both
station-master and drivers advised me to wait till it was over. I
listened to their advice, but an unaccountable restlessness took
possession of me, just as though someone was pushing me on. Meanwhile,
the snowstorm did not abate. I could bear it no longer, and again
ordered the horses, and started in the midst of the storm. The driver
took it into his head to drive along the river, which would shorten the
distance by three miles. The banks were covered with snowdrifts; the
driver missed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
the turning which would have brought us out on to the road, and we
turned up in an unknown place. The storm never ceased. I could discern a
light, and told the driver to make for it. We entered a village, and
found that the light proceeded from a wooden church. The church was
open. Outsides the railings stood several sledges, and people passing in
and out through the porch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Here! here!&#39; cried several voices. I
told the coachman to drive up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Where have you dawdled?&#39; said someone
to me. &#39;The bride has fainted; the priest does not know what to do;
we were on the point of going back. Make haste and get out!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got out of the sledge in silence, and stepped
into the church, which was dimly lighted with two or three tapers. A
girl was sitting in a dark corner on a bench; another girl was rubbing
her temples. &#39;Thank God,&#39; said the latter, &#39;you have come at
last! You have nearly been the death of the young lady.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old priest approached me, saying,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Shall I begin?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Begin&mdash;begin, reverend father,&#39; I
replied, absently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The young lady was raised up. I thought her
rather pretty. Oh, wild, unpardonable frivolity! I placed myself by her
side at the altar. The priest hurried on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Three men and the maid supported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
the bride, and occupied themselves with her alone. We were married!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Kiss your wife,&#39; said the priest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My wife turned her pale face towards me. I was
going to kiss her, when she exclaimed, &#39;Oh! it is not he&mdash;not
he!&#39; and fell back insensible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 597px;">
<img src="images/Scan266.jpg" width="597" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;IT IS NOT HE!&mdash;NOT HE!&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;The witnesses stared at me. I turned round and
left the church without any attempt being made to stop me, threw myself
into the sledge, and cried, &#39;Away!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; exclaimed Maria. &quot;And you
don&#39;t know what became of your unhappy wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not,&quot; replied Bourmin; &quot;neither
do I know the name of the village where I was married, nor that of the
station from which I started. At that time I thought so little of my
wicked joke that, on driving away from the church, I fell asleep, and
never woke till early the next morning, after reaching the third
station. The servant who was with me died during the campaign, so that I
have now no hope of ever discovering the unhappy woman on whom I played
such a cruel trick, and who is now so cruelly avenged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great heavens!&quot; cried Maria, seizing his
hand. &quot;Then it was you, and you do not recognise me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bourmin turned pale&mdash;and threw himself at her
feet.</p>

<p class="cap">THE above is the legend that is painted on the door of
every cell occupied by a monk of the silent Order of Carthusians. To
pray always for those who never pray; to pray for those who have done
you wrong; to pray for those who sin every hour of their lives; to pray
for all sorts and conditions of men, no matter what their colour, no
matter what their creed; to pray that God will remove doubt and
scepticism from the world, and open all human eyes to the way of faith
and salvation. Such is the chief duty of the Chartreux. That the lives
of these men is a continual prayer would seem to be an undoubted fact;
but they are more than that&mdash;they are lives of silence, that must
not be broken, save under exceptional circumstances. Time has been when
they were surrounded by their families, their friends, when perhaps they
had ambitions like other men, hopes like other men, and, it may be, have
given their love to women. But then something has happened to change the
current of their lives, the course of their thought: the mundane world
has become distasteful, and with heavy hearts and weary feet they have
sought the lonely monastery, and, having once entered, the door has
closed upon them for ever. Henceforth the horizon of their world is the
monastery wall; and the only sounds they will hear save the wind when it
howls, or the thunder when it rolls, are the eternal tolling of the
bell, and the wail and chant of the monotonous prayers. It is difficult
to understand how men, young, rich, well-favoured, can seclude
themselves in this busy and wonderful age; and, renouncing all the
pleasures and gaiety of the world, take upon themselves solemn vows of
chastity and silence, which, once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
taken, are devoutly kept. To God and God&#39;s service they dedicate
themselves; and though on the earth, they are scarcely of it. They live,
but for them it is the beginning of eternity; the passion and fret of
the world will never more disturb them, and their one longing is to
change the finite for the infinite. It is surely no ordinary faith that
impels men to enter into a living death of this kind, nor is it
fanaticism, but a devotion too deep for words, too mysterious for
ordinary comprehensions to grasp. One must go back to the eleventh
century for the beginning of the history of this strange Order. It was
founded by St. Bruno, of Cologne, who imposed upon his votaries
&quot;Solitude,&quot; &quot;Silence,&quot; and &quot;Fasting.&quot; For
above eight hundred years the Carthusians have been true to their saint,
and wherever they have established themselves they have lived their
lives of silence, knowing nothing of the seductive and tender influence
of women, or the love and sweetness of children; dying, when their time
came, without a pang of regret at leaving the world, and with nothing to
perpetuate their memories, save a tiny wooden cross, on which a number
is painted. But in half a dozen years or so the cross rots away, and is
never renewed, and the dead brother is referred to no more.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The lonely convent of the Grande Chartreuse is as old
as the Order, although it has undergone considerable change. It is now a
great building, occupying a considerable extent of ground, but
originally it must have been a single small house. It stands in a
defile, in a region of utter loneliness. Gradually it has grown and
expanded, and in order to protect it against the attacks of thieves and
marauders, it is surrounded by a massive wall that is loopholed and
embrasured. For what purpose it is difficult to say, for these monks
would never take human life, not even to save their own. So far,
however, as I have been able to learn there is no record of the convent
having been seriously attacked during any period of its history. But in
the Revolution of 1792 the monks were cruelly expelled, and their most
valuable library was destroyed. They separated in little groups, and
found refuge in holy houses of their order in different parts of Europe,
until the restoration of 1815&mdash;that memorable year&mdash;when they
reunited and returned to their beloved monastery amid the solitude of
the eternal mountains.</p>

<p class="indent">La Grande Chartreuse is situated amidst scenes of
savage grandeur, 3,800 feet above the sea, at the foot of the Mont Grand
Som, which reaches a height of 6,668 feet, and commands a view of
surpassing magnificence. It is in the Department of Isère, France, and
eight hours&#39; journey from Grenoble, which is the capital of the
Department, and famous for its gloves. The nearest railway station is a
five hours&#39; journey away, and there is no other human habitation
within many miles of the convent. The approaches are by wild and rugged
gorges, through which excellent roads have of late years been made, but
formerly these gorges might have been held by a handful of men against a
host. In the winter the roads are blocked with snow, and between the
lonely convent and the outer world there is little communication. In
summer the pine woods look solemn and dark, and the ravines are filled
with the music of falling waters. There is a strange absence of bird
melody, and the wind sighs amongst the pines, and moans around the
rocks. And yet the region is one of entrancing beauty, and full of a
dreamy repose that makes its influence felt.</p>

<p class="indent">To this lonely convent I travelled one day in the late
autumn, when the falling leaves spoke sadly of departed summer glories,
and the shrill blasts that came down the glens were messengers from the
regions of ice and snow. I had gone by train to Voiron, between Rives
and Grenoble, and thence had tramped through the beautiful gorges of
Crossey for five hours. The afternoon had been sullen, and bitterly
cold, and the shades of night were fast falling as, weary and hungry, I
rang the great bell at the convent gate, and begged for hospitality. A
tall, cowled monk received me, but uttered no word. He merely made a
sign for me to follow him, and, closing the gate and shooting the
massive bolts, he led the way across a court, where I was met by another
monk, who was allowed to break the rigid vow of silence so far that he
could inquire of strangers what their business was. He asked me if I
desired food and rest, and on my answering in the affirmative he led me
to a third and silent brother, and by him I was conducted to a cell with
whitewashed walls. It contained a small bed of unpainted pine wood, and
a tiny table, on which was an iron basin and a jug of water. A crucifix
hung on the wall, and beneath it was a <i>prie-dieu</i>. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
cell was somehow suggestive of a prison, and yet I am not sure that
there was as much comfort to be found in it as a prison cell affords in
these humanitarian times. Everything about the Grande Chartreuse is of
Spartan-like simplicity. There the body is mortified for the soul&#39;s
sake, and nothing that could pander in the least degree to luxurious
tastes is allowed. As I was to learn afterwards, even such barren
comfort as is afforded by this &quot;Visitor&#39;s Cell&quot; is unknown
in the cells occupied by the monks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/Scan270.jpg" width="636" height="609" alt="A VISITORS CELL" title="A VISITORS CELL" />
</div>

<p class="indent">When I had somewhat freshened myself up by a wash, I
went into the corridor where my attendant was waiting, and, following
him in obedience to a sign he made, I traversed a long, lofty, cold
passage, with bare walls and floor. At the end of the passage there was
carved in the stone the Latin inscription, <i>Stat crux dum volvitur
orbis</i>. Passing through an arched doorway we reached the refectory.
The great hall or supper room was cold, barren, and dismal. Everything
looked ghostly and dim in the feeble light shed by two small swinging
lamps, that seemed rather to emphasise the gloom than dispel it. Comfort
there was none in this echoing chamber, with its whitewashed walls and
shadowy recesses, from which I half expected to see the spirit forms of
dead monks glide. Taking my seat at a small, bare table, a silent
brother placed before me a bowl of thin vegetable soup, in which some
chopped eggs floated. Fish followed, then an omelette, and the whole was
washed down with a bottle of excellent red wine. It was a frugal repast,
but an Epicurean spread as compared with the dietary scale of the monks
themselves. Meat of every kind is rigorously interdicted, that is, the
flesh of animals in any form. Each brother only gets two meals a day.
They consist of hot water flavoured with egg; vegetables cooked in oil;
while the only drink allowed is cold water. The monks do not eat
together except on Sundays and religious <i>fête</i> days, when they all
sup in the refectory.</p>

<p class="indent">On other days every man has his meals alone, in the
solitude of his cell, and but a brief time is allowed him, for it is
considered sinful to spend more time in eating and drinking than is
absolutely necessary to swallow down so much food as will hold body and
soul together. That men may keep themselves healthy, even on such meagre
diet as that I have mentioned, is proved by the monks of the Grande
Chartreuse, for they enjoy excellent health, and generally live to a
green old age. Even the weak and delicate grow strong and hardy under
the severe discipline. The rasping friction of the nervous system, which
annually slays its tens of thousands in the outer world, is unknown
here. All is calm and peaceful, and the austerity of the life led is
compensated for by the abiding and hopeful faith. It is a brief
preparation for an eternal life of unsullied joy in a world where
man&#39;s sin is known no more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
Surely nothing else but such a faith could sustain mortal beings under
an ordeal so trying.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">This strange community of Carthusians is divided into
categories of &quot;Fathers&quot; and &quot;Brothers.&quot; The former
wear robes of white wool, cinctured with a girdle of white leather.
Their heads and faces are closely shaven, and the head is generally
enveloped in a cowl, which is attached to the robe. They are all
ordained priests, and it is to them the rule of silence, solitude, and
fasting, more particularly applies. The fasting is represented by the
daily bill of fare I have given, and it never varies all the year round,
except on Fridays and certain days in Lent, when, poor as it is, it is
still further reduced. The solitude consists of many hours spent in
prayer in the loneliness of the cell, and the silence imposed is only
broken by monosyllabic answers to questions addressed to them. Sustained
conversation is a fault, and would be severely punished. Aspirants for
the Fatherhood have to submit to a most trying novitiate, which lasts
for five full years. After that they are ordained, and from that moment
they renounce the world, with all its luring temptations and its sin.
Their lives henceforth must be strictly holy in accordance with the
tenets of their religion. The Brothers are the manual labourers, the
hewers of wood and drawers of water. They do everything that is required
in the way of domestic service. They wear sandals on their bare feet,
and their bodies are clothed in a long, loose, brown robe, fastened at
the waist by a rope girdle. On both branches of the Order the same
severe <i>régime</i> is compulsory, but on Fridays the Brothers only get
a morsel of black bread and a cup of cold water. The attention to
spiritual duties is all-absorbing, and under no circumstances must it be
relaxed. Matins commence in the chapel at twelve o&#39;clock at night,
and continue until about two o&#39;clock. After a short rest, the Divine
service is resumed at six o&#39;clock. But all the monks do not attend
the matins at one time. While some sleep others pray. And it is doubtful
if amongst the religious orders of the world anything more solemn and
impressive than this midnight service could be found. To witness it was
my chief aim in going to the convent, and so I left my cell after a
short sleep, and proceeded to the chapel as the deep-toned bell struck
twelve with sonorous sounds that rolled in ghostly echoes along the
lofty corridors. The passage through which I made my way was a vast one,
and a solitary lamp ineffectually struggled to illumine the darkness. I
groped along until I reached a door that swung silently open to my
touch. Then I stood within the chapel, where all was silent, and a
Cimmerian gloom reigned. Far in the depths of the darkness was a
glimmering, star-like lamp over the altar, but its beams, feeble and
straggling, revealed nothing, it only accentuated the pitchy blackness
all around. The feeble lanterns of the monks, one to every third stall,
were invisible from my position. Everything was suggestive of a tomb far
down in the bowels of the earth&mdash;the silence, the cold, the damp
earthy smell that filled one&#39;s nostrils, all seemed to indicate
decaying mortality. Suddenly, with startling abruptness, a single voice
broke into a plaintive, monotonous chant. Then others took up the cadence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
with a moaning wail that gradually died away until there was unbroken
silence again. There was something strange and weird in this
performance, for the impenetrable darkness, the star-like lamp, the
wailing voices of unseen figures, seemed altogether unnatural. It begot
in me a shudder that I could not repress, for the moaning and wailing
appeared to be associated with death rather than life. There was nothing
in the whole ceremony indicative of joy or hope, but rather their
converse&mdash;sadness and despair. Throughout those weary hours the
wailing chant and the silence alternated. I wanted to go away, but could
not. Some strange fascination kept me there, and I recalled some of the
wonderful descriptive scenes in Dantè which were irresistibly suggested.
My imagination was wrought on to such an extent that I pictured that
vast gloomy space as filled with unquiet spirits condemned to torture;
and the lamp as typical of the one ray of hope that told them that after
a long period of penance they should pass from the gloom of woe to the
lightness and joy of eternal day, when their anguish should cease for
ever and rest be found. At last, to my great relief, I saw the beams of
a new morn steal in at the chapel windows. The bowed forms of the cowled
monks were faintly discernible, kneeling before the altar, where still
burned the watch-lamp. One by one they rose and flitted away like
shadows; no sound came from their footfalls, no rustle from their
garments. Warmly clad though I was, I shivered with the cold, and was
cramped with the position I had maintained for hours; for I had been
fearful of moving lest any harsh, grating noise should break in upon
that solemn and impressive silence. When all had gone I too went, and
made my way back to the cell, where I tried to snatch a few hours&#39;
sleep, but it was all in vain, for my mind seemed as if it had been
upset by a strange and terrible dream. Although I have had a wide and
varied experience of men and manners in all parts of the world, I never
witnessed such a strange scene before as I witnessed that night. It was
like a nightmare picture, a poem evolved from a distorted imagination. I
say a poem because it had the elements of poetry in it, but it was the
poetry of ineffable human sadness.</p>

<p class="indent">Truly it is singular that men can so strengthen their
faith, so enwrap themselves, as it were, in a gloomy creed, that they
are willing to deny themselves every pleasure in life, to shut
themselves off from all that is joyous and beautiful in the world, in
order to submit to an endless sorrowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
for human sins; a sorrowing that finds expression every hour of their
lonely, saddened lives. For from sunset to sunrise, and sunrise to
sunset again, they are warned by the mournful tolling of the iron bell,
every quivering stroke of which seems to say &quot;death,&quot; to pray
without ceasing.</p>

<p class="caption">A MONKS CELL</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Many of the monks at the Grande Chartreuse are still
in the very prime of their manhood, and not a few of them are members of
distinguished and wealthy families. Yet they have renounced everything;
all the advantages that influence and wealth could give them; all the
comforts of home; the love of wife and children; the fascination of
travel and of strange sights&mdash;every temptation that this most
beautiful world could hold out has been resisted, and they have
dedicated themselves to gloom, fasting, and silence. Verily, human
nature is an unfathomable mystery. One may well ask if these monks are
truly happy? If they have no longings for the flesh-pots of Egypt? If
they do not sometimes pine and sigh for the busy haunts and the
excitement of the great towns? Such questions are not easily answered,
unless we get the answer in the fact that the monastic vows are
faithfully and religiously kept; and there is no record of a Carthusian
monk ever having broken his vow. Surely then there must be something
strangely, even terribly attractive in that stern life which is so full
of hardship and trial, and from year&#39;s end to year&#39;s end knows
no change, until the great change which comes to us all, sooner or
later, whether we be monks or revellers.</p>

<p class="indent">I have already mentioned that notwithstanding their
sparse and meagre diet, which seems to us ordinary mortals to lack
nutriment and sustaining power, the monks of the Grande Chartreuse are
healthy and vigorous. The Brothers labour in their fields and gardens,
and they cultivate all the vegetables that they use, as well as grow
most of their own corn for the bread. They do any bricklaying,
carpentering, or painting that may be required, as well as all the
washing and mending of the establishment, for a woman is never allowed
to enter the sacred precincts. The furniture of each cell consists of a
very narrow bed as hard as a board, and with little covering; a small
stove, for the rigours of the climate

render a fire indispensable at times, and yet the fires are used but
sparingly; a little basin, with a jug of water for ablutions; and of
course there is the <i>prie-dieu</i>, and the image of a saint. Attached
to the convent is a cemetery, which cannot fail to have a very
melancholy interest for the visitor. It is divided into two parts, one
being for the Fathers, the other for the Brothers, for as the two
branches of the Order are kept distinct in life, so they are separated
in death. No mounds mark the last resting-places of the quiet sleepers;
but at the head of each is a wooden cross, though it bears no indication
of the name, age, or date of death of the deceased&mdash;only a number.
Having played his little part and returned to the dust from whence he
sprang, it is considered meet that the Carthusian should be forgotten.
And the cross is merely an indication that beneath moulder the remains
of what was once a man.</p>

<p class="indent">As is well known, the monks distil the famous liqueur
which finds its way to all parts of the world, and yields a very
handsome revenue. The process of its concoction is an inviolable secret,
but it is largely composed of herbs and cognac. It is said that the
recipe was brought to the convent by one of the fathers, who had been
expelled in 1792, and that at first the liqueur was used as a medicine
and distributed amongst the poor. In the course of time, however, it was
improved upon, for its fame having spread a demand for it sprang up, and
it was resolved to make it an article of commerce. For this purpose a
separate building was erected apart from the monastery, and placed in
charge of one of the Fathers, who has a staff of brothers under him. The
basis of the liqueur is supposed to be an indigenous mountain herb
combined with the petals of certain wild flowers. These are macerated
with honey until fermentation takes place. The liquid is then refined
and brandy is added. Formerly it was made without brandy. The
&quot;green&quot; is most favoured by connaisseurs, and its exquisite,
delicate fragrance and flavour have never been imitated. More care is
bestowed upon the &quot;green&quot; than the &quot;yellow,&quot; which
is somewhat inferior in quality and of a coarser flavour. On several
occasions very large sums have been offered for the right to manufacture
the chartreuse by financial speculators, but all such offers have been
resolutely refused. Although I believe that the greater part of the
income of the convent is spent in deeds of charity, it may be doubted by
some people whether it is not a somewhat questionable way for a
religious Order to augment its funds by the preparation of an
intoxicating liquor for which, according to their own doctrine, there is
absolutely no need. The chartreuse has a strong rival in the well-known
benedictine, made by the Benedictine Monks; and which, while being
similar in character, is said by some to be superior. There is little
doubt, however, that the chartreuse has much the larger sale of the two.
Many attempts have been made from time to time by outsiders to
manufacture both these liqueurs, but without success, and the exact
secret of their decoction is as religiously preserved as are the secrets
of Freemasonry.</p>

<p class="indent">Like the Great St. Bernard, the Grande Chartreuse,
though not to the same extent, is a show place in summer. Perhaps this
is hardly a fair way of putting it, for it would be a cruel injustice to
let it be supposed that the Chartreux had the slightest desire to make
an exhibition of their lonely convent. But the travelling facilities
afforded the tourist nowadays enable him to penetrate to the remotest
recesses of the earth. No place is sacred to him; and as he thinks
nothing of going into a Continental theatre dressed in a tweed suit, so
he does not hesitate, garbed in hob-nailed boots and knickerbockers, to
demand entrance into the Grande Chartreuse, whose mystery he does not
understand and cares nought for, and whose solemnity does not awe him.
To refuse hospitality even to the irreverent curiosity-monger would be
contrary to the Carthusian&#39;s creed, which teaches charity to all
men, and to &quot;turn no deaf ear to him who asks for bread and
succour.&quot; And so anything of the masculine gender is admitted and
fed with the frugal fare that is now specially provided for visitors;
and very properly he who partakes of this hospitality, not being in
actual want of it, is required to pay for his entertainment. The
ordinary visitor is not allowed to pass the night under the roof of the
convent, and therefore that strange and ghostly service in the chapel
during the hours of darkness is rarely witnessed. The Grande Chartreuse
boasts of a magnificent library, which numbers upwards of 20,000
volumes, for the most part of a theological nature. Many of these books
are unique and of great age,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
and to the theological student would probably prove a mine of wealth.
Amongst the volumes are some very rare Bibles and Prayer-books of nearly
every civilised country in the world. This library replaces the one that
was destroyed, and has been collected during the present century.</p>

<p class="caption">CARTHUSIAN BROTHERS IN THE KITCHEN</p>

<p class="indent">What is known as the Chapter-room is an exception to
the rest of the place, inasmuch as it is hung with portraits of the
Father Superiors from the very foundation of the Order. There are about
fifty of these portraits altogether, and some of the earlier ones are
more curious than artistic. The &quot;Superiors&quot; are the only men
of the Order whose memory is thus kept alive.</p>

<p class="indent">The Grand Cloister is the largest apartment in the
building. It is a not quite perfect square, and is lighted by a hundred
and thirty windows. A portion of this cloister dates back to the early
part of the thirteenth century. There are two main corridors, seven
hundred and twenty-two feet long, and abutting on these corridors are
the cells, thirty-six in number. There is also a Chapelle des Morts,
built about the end of the thirteenth century. Here the bodies of the
dead monks rest during the religious services that are held over them
before they are finally consigned to the little cemetery to which I have
already made reference. Nor must I forget to mention what is known as
the Map-room, where there is a very valuable collection of maps of
different parts of the world, but particularly of France. There is also
a small museum of insects and butterflies indigenous to the mountains of
the region in which the convent is situated. That region is the southern
group of the singularly interesting limestone Alps of Savoy, and the
convent stands in about the middle section of the group which culminates
in the Pointe de Chamchaude, 6,845 feet high.</p>

<p class="indent">In choosing the site for the convent, there is little
doubt that isolation as well as a position of natural defence were aimed
at. Isolated it truly is, and up to a couple of hundred years ago it
must have been absolutely impregnable. But it is well known that the
monks of old had an eye also to beauty of surroundings, and it is
doubtful if the faithful followers of St. Bruno could have found a site
commanding a view of more magnificent beauty in all France than that
which the Grande Chartreuse occupies, and by ascending to the summit of
the Grand Som, which throws its shadow over the convent, a panorama of
unsurpassed grandeur is unfolded to the wondering gaze. To the west it
embraces the valley of the Rhône, the town of Lyons, and the mountains
of Ardèche and Forez; to the east the chain of glittering Alps that
stretches from Mont Visio to Mont Blanc; to the north is the Mont du
Chat of Chambéry, the Lake of Bourget, and that part of the Rhône Valley
which is bounded by the rugged peaks of the purple Jura, while to the
south are smiling valleys and rolling uplands.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
This view of the outer world is all the monks ever obtain, for, having
once taken the vows, they leave the convent no more; and they know
little of what goes on in the busy haunts of men, where the passion of
life reaches fever heat, save what they gather from the chattering of
the throngs of summer idlers. In winter they live in a silent, white
world, and the face of a stranger is very rarely seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Before leaving the neighbourhood I paid a visit to the
Chapelle de St. Bruno, which is within half an hour&#39;s walk of the
monastery. It is erected in a very wild spot, said to be the site of the
saint&#39;s original hermitage. There is nothing particularly
interesting in the chapel, which is in a state of dilapidation. But it
is curious to speculate that here dwelt, in what was little more than a
cavern, the man who, by the austerity of his life and his gloomy views,
was able to found a religious Order which has endured for many ages, and
is one of the few that escaped destruction during the revolutions and
upheavals of the last century. The situation of the Chapelle is one of
singular loneliness and desolation, and for eight months of the year at
least it is buried in snow.</p>

<p class="indent">As I turned my back upon the Grande Chartreuse, after
that memorable night spent under its roof, and feeling grateful for the
shelter and refreshment it had afforded me, the morning sun was gilding
the glorious landscape, and I breathed a sigh of relief and gladness,
for I seemed to have come from a region of sorrow and gloom, where the
coldness of death was ever present, into the healthy, joyous life of the
throbbing, breathing world.</p>

<h3>THE DUKE OF ARGYLL.<br />
Born 1823.</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Scan280-4.jpg" alt="A" width="117" height="115" class="cap" />
<p class="cap">AT the age of eight-and-twenty the Duke of Argyll, who
had succeeded to the dukedom four years earlier, was already well known
as a writer, a politician, and a public speaker, and as one who took
keen interest in all Scottish questions which came before the public. At
this age, also, he was elected Chancellor of the University of St.
Andrews, and was already, what he has since remained, one of the most
prominent figures in the House of Lords. The Duke, who has held many of
the highest offices, in various Governments, was, at the age at which he
is represented in our second picture, Secretary of State for India under
Mr. Gladstone. But as a politician the Duke&#39;s position is not easy
to define; he has been described as &quot;Whig by family, Liberal by
intellect, Independent by nature, and Conservative by inclination.&quot;
But it is in questions of science and theology rather than in politics
that the Duke&#39;s name is known, and his most celebrated book,
&quot;The Reign of Law,&quot; was considered by Darwin himself so
powerful an attack upon the Theory of Descent as to call for special
refutation.</p>

<p class="cap">THE first photograph we give of Mr. Herbert Beerbohm
Tree, shows him at the age of five, then a cherubic and rosy boy of
seemingly serious disposition. The second likeness represents him at
seventeen, soon after he had left the college of Schnepfenthal in
Thuringia, where he received his education, but where, according to his
own modest statement, he acquired no distinction in the walks of
learning. But so great was his evident talent for acting that he was
persuaded to adopt the stage as a profession, with what instant success
we all know. He became manager of the Haymarket in 1887. As a manager he
has shown not only enterprise, but an almost quixotic liberality. His
latest Monday night venture has proved one of the happiest of his many
happy thoughts.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM BLACK.<br />
<span class="smcap">Born</span> 1841.</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Scan283-4.jpg" alt="M" width="113" height="115" class="cap" />
<p class="cap">MR. BLACK&#39;S ambition as a boy was to become an
artist, and he studied for a short time in the School of Art at Glasgow,
in which city he was born. &quot;As an artist,&quot; he tells us,
&quot;I was a complete failure, and so qualified myself for a time in
after life as an art critic.&quot; Yet in feeling for the beauty of sea,
forest, moor, and hill, and in graphic power of painting them in words,
Mr. Black has rarely had a rival. At twenty, the age at which our first
portrait shows him, he had already turned to journalism, and was writing
in the <i>Glasgow Weekly Citizen</i>. Three years afterwards he came to
London, where he wrote for newspapers and magazines. During the
Prusso-Austrian War of 1866 he acted as the Special Correspondent of the
<i>Morning Star</i>. Scenes taken from his adventures appeared in his
first novel, &quot;Love or Marriage,&quot; which he wrote on his return.
Several other novels followed during the next four or five years, none
of which had any great success; but in 1871, just at the age depicted in
our second portrait, Mr. Black produced the striking story&mdash;&quot;A
Daughter of Heth.&quot; Since then, his books have become household
words, and probably no living author has given pleasure to so many
readers by means at once so simple and so fine. With less of plot and
startling incident than almost any novelist, Mr. Black has two points of
excellence in which he stands alone&mdash;in power of painting scenery
and of depicting charming girls.</p>

<h3>CHARLES WYNDHAM.</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Scan283-4.jpg" alt="M" width="113" height="115" class="cap" />
<p class="cap">MR. CHARLES WYNDHAM was, at eighteen, the age at which
our first portrait represents him, a medical student at Liverpool, at
which city he was born; but having taken his degrees of L.R.C.S. and
L.S.A., he went, at twenty-one, to America, and made his first
appearance as an actor at Washington, with John Wilkes Booth, to whose
<i>Hamlet</i> he played <i>Osric</i>. Booth, who perhaps was never
wholly sane, and who three years later made himself a name of world-wide
infamy by shooting President Lincoln in a theatre-box, saw so little
sign of genius in the new actor that he discharged him for incompetency.
Mr. Wyndham then served as surgeon to the 19th Army Corps, and was
present at some of the most deadly battles of the Civil War. His
appearance at that time was that of our second portrait, which
represents him in his uniform. Two years later, on his return to
England, he again went on the boards, and entered at once upon the
career which has long been recognised as that of the finest light
comedian at present on the stage.</p>

<h3>HENRY M. STANLEY.</h3>

<p class="cap">AT 19, John Rowlands, a poor Welsh boy, had emigrated
to America, had been adopted by a merchant of the name of Stanley, and
had assumed the latter name. At 22, his adopting father having died
without a will, young Stanley was serving as a petty officer on board
the war-ship <i>Minnesota</i>. At 26 he had become a journalist, and was
about to represent the <i>New York Herald</i> with the British army in
Abyssinia. On returning from this expedition he delivered lectures on
his adventures, a handbill of which we reproduce on the page opposite,
as a veritable curiosity. At 31 he had discovered Dr. Livingstone, and
had returned with glory. What Mr. Stanley has done recently is known to
all the world.</p>

<p class="cap">NO tales of heroism are more thrilling and exciting
than the narratives of the exploits which have gained the coveted reward
of the Victoria Cross; and a story never has so much reality and
vividness as when it comes first-hand from the performer of the deed.
Accordingly, we have asked a number of the heroes of the Victoria
Cross&mdash;a truly noble army&mdash;to relate in their own language how
they came to win the most glorious decoration open to a soldier, the
plain bronze cross &quot;For Valour.&quot; The narratives which follow
require no further introduction, and will, we think, be found to possess
an interest which is all their own&mdash;the interest and impression of
reality.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sergeant Ablett.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">One of the most gallant acts which can be conceived is
the seizing a live shell and casting it away, so as to prevent mischief
from its explosion. A second&#39;s delay may be fatal, and the man who
picks up the shell cannot tell whether the second in question will be
allowed him. If it bursts in his hands it means certain death. Not only
the greatest, but also the promptest, courage is needed for such an act
of courage. Among the few who have performed such a feat is Sergeant
Ablett, late Grenadier Guards, whose own modest account is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">On the 2nd September, 1854, when in the trenches
before Sebastopol, the sentries shouted &quot;Look out there!&quot; a
shell coming right in the trenches at the same moment and dropping
amongst some barrels of ammunition. I at once pulled it from them. It
ran between my legs, and I then picked it up and threw it out of the
trench; it burst as it touched the ground. From the force of it I fell,
and was covered by its explosion with gravel and dirt.</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Baker and others picked me up, and asked if I
was hurt. I said, &quot;No; but I have had a good shaking.&quot; There
was a great number in the trenches at the time, but I am glad to say no
one was hurt. The Sergeant reported the circumstances to the officer in
charge.</p>

<p class="indent">On coming off duty I was taken before the commanding
officer, and promoted to the rank of Corporal, and then Sergeant. He
also presented me with a silk necktie made by her most gracious Majesty.
I was at the battles of Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman, and the capture of
Sebastopol after eleven months&#39; siege. This is all I think I need
say as to myself and the Victoria Cross. My likeness is to be found in
Victoria Cross Picture Gallery, Crystal Palace, and Alexandra
Palace.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Major John Berryman.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">Among those who won the Victoria Cross at Balaclava
none gained it more worthily than Major John Berryman, who served in the
Crimea as Troop-Sergeant Major in the 17th Lancers. This is how Major
Berryman describes the charge of the Light Brigade:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Gallop!&quot; was the order as the firing became
general. And here a discharge from the battery in our front, whose guns
were doubly shotted, first with shot or shell, and then with case, swept
away Captain Winter and the whole division on my right. The gap was
noticed by Captain Morris, who gave the order, &quot;Right
incline,&quot; but a warning voice came from my coverer in the rear rank
(Corporal John Penn), &quot;Keep straight on, Jack; keep straight
on.&quot; He saw what I did not, that we were opposite the intervals of
the guns, and thus we escaped, for the next round must have swept us
into eternity. My attention here was attracted to James Melrose, a
Shakespearian reciter, calling out, &quot;What man here would ask
another man from England?&quot; Poor fellow, they were the last words he
spoke, for the next round from the guns killed him and many others. We
were then so close to the guns that the report rang through my head, and
I felt that I was quite deaf for a time. It was this round that broke my
mare&#39;s off hind leg, and caused her to stop instantly. I felt that I
was hit, but not till I dismounted. Seeing that the mare&#39;s leg was
broken, I debated in my own mind whether to shoot her or not, when
Captain Webb came up to me, and asked me, was I wounded? I replied,
&quot;Only slightly, I thought, in the leg, but that my horse was
shot.&quot; I then asked, &quot;Are you hurt, sir?&quot; He said that he
was, and in the leg, too; what had he better do? &quot;Keep to your
horse, sir, and get back as far as you can.&quot; He turned, and rode
back. I now caught a loose horse, and got on to his back, but he fell
directly, the brass of the breast-plate having been driven into his
chest. Seeing that there was no hope of my joining the regiment in the
<i>mêlée</i>, and the 11th Hussars being close upon me, I moved a little
to the right, so as to pass through the interval between the squadrons.
Both squadrons closed in a little, and let me pass through. I well
remember that Sergeant Gutteridge was the right guide of the 2nd
squadron. Finding that Captain Webb had halted, I ran to him, and on
inquiries found that his wound was so painful that he could not ride any
further. Lieutenant George Smith, of my own regiment, coming by, I got
him to stand at the horse&#39;s head whilst I lifted the captain off.
Having accomplished this, I assisted Smith to mount Webb&#39;s horse,
and ride for a stretcher, taking notice where we were. By this time the
Russians had got back to their guns, and re-opened fire. I saw six men
of my own regiment get together to recount to each other their escapes.
Seeing their danger, I called to them to separate, but too late, for a
shell dropped amongst them, and I don&#39;t think one escaped alive.
Hearing me call to these men, Captain Webb asked what I thought the
Russians would do?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are sure to pursue, sir, unless the Heavy
Brigade comes down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you had better consult your own safety, and
leave me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no, sir, I shall not leave you now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps they will only take me
prisoner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If they do, sir, we will go together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t mind me, look to yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, sir; only we will go together,
whatever happens.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just at this time I saw Sergeant Farrell coming by. I
called to him. He asked, &quot;Who is it?&quot; When told, he came over.
I said, &quot;We must get Captain Webb out of this, for we shall be
pursued.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He agreeing, we made a chair of our hands, lifted the
Captain up, and found that we could carry him with comparative ease. We
had got about 200 yards in this manner, when the Captain complained that
his leg was very painful. A private of the 13th being near, Malone, I
asked him would he be good enough to support Captain Webb&#39;s legs,
until we could procure a stretcher? He did so, and several of the
officers passed us. Sir G. Wombwell said, &quot;What is the matter,
Peck?&quot; (Captain Webb&#39;s nickname.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hit in the leg, old fellow. How did you
escape?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I was unhorsed and taken prisoner, but
when the second line came down, in the confusion I got away, and,
seizing the first horse I could, I got away, and I find that it is
Morris&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sir W. Gordon made the same inquiry, and got the same
answer. He had a very nasty cut on the head, and blood was then running
down his face. He was carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
his dress cap in his hand. We had now reached the rear of the Greys, and
I procured a stretcher from two Infantry band boys, and a young officer
of the &quot;Greys&quot; gave me a &quot;tourniquet,&quot; saying that
he did not know how to apply it, but perhaps I might. I put it on the
right thigh, and screwed it up. Doctor Kendal came here, and I pointed
out what I had done, and asked was it right?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could not have done it better myself; bring
him along.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan288.jpg" width="600" height="552" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;I LIFTED THE CAPTAIN OFF.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">I and Farrell now raised the stretcher and carried it
for about fifty yards, and again set it down. I was made aware of an
officer of the Chasseurs d&#39;Afrique being on my left by his placing
his hand upon my shoulder. I turned and saluted. Pointing to Captain
Webb, but looking at me, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your officer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! and you sergeant?&quot; looking at the
stripes on my arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! If you were in French service, I would make
you an officer on the spot.&quot; Then, standing in his stirrups and
extending his right hand, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! it was grand, it was <i>magnifique</i>, but
it is not war, it is not war.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This officer was General Morris. We resumed our
patient, and got to the doctors (Massy and Kendal). I saw the boot cut
off and the nature of the wound, the right shin bone being shattered.
Farrell made an exclamation, and I was motioned to take him away. I told
him that I should go and see the end of it. He said that he was too
exhausted to do any more. Finding a horse in the lines, I mounted him,
although the animal belonged to the 4th Light Dragoons, and thus dropped
in behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
the Duke of Cambridge, and heard what passed. The Duke, speaking to Lord
Cardigan, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cardigan, where&#39;s the Brigade,
then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; said Cardigan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that all of them? You have lost the finest
Brigade that ever left the shores of England.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A little further on he spoke to Captain Godfrey Morgan
(Lord Tredegar):&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morgan, where&#39;s the regiment,
then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Royal Highness, that is all of
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My poor regiment, my poor regiment!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I now took my place in the ranks, and, in numbering
off, being on the extreme left, I counted 22. We fell back during the
night, and, being dismounted, I, with my servant, was left behind. I
suffered intensely with my head, and got a napkin and tied it as tightly
as possible round my brows. I also had time to examine my wound, which
was inside the calf of my leg. A small piece about the size of a
shilling had been cut clean out of my leg; but except that the blood had
run into my boots, I felt but very little inconvenience from it. Cold
water bandage was all I used; but, unfortunately, scurvy got to it, and
it was a long time healing.</p>

modest and soldier-like style thus describes the exploit which won for
him the Victoria Cross:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">On the night of December 19, 1854, I was placed on
single sentry at some distance in front of the advanced sentries of an
out-lying picquet in the White Horse Ravine&mdash;a post of much danger,
and requiring great vigilance. The Russian picquet was posted 300 yards
in our front. Three Russian soldiers advanced under cover of the
brushwood for the purpose of reconnoitring. I immediately fired my
rifle, which was the signal of alarm, and then jumped into the trench
almost on the top of the three Russians, two of whom I succeeded
single-handed in taking prisoners, and marched them into our lines, the
other one having fled back to the Russian lines.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Private James Davis.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">The attack on Fort Ruhiya on April 15, 1858, gave an
opportunity for much display of courage and devotion. Among those who
conspicuously distinguished themselves was Private James Davis, of the
42nd Highlanders. This gallant soldier, who had previously served
throughout the Crimean War, also saw much fighting during the Indian
Mutiny, and for his conduct at Fort Ruhiya was awarded the Victoria
Cross.</p>

<p class="indent">The following is his account of the feat which won for
him the much-prized honour:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I belonged to the Light Company, under the command of
Captain (now Sir John) Macleod.  We got orders to lie down under some
trees for a short time. Two Engineer officers came up and asked for some
men to come with them to see where they could make a breach with the
artillery. I was one who went. There was a small garden ditch under the
walls of the fort, not high enough to cover our heads. After a short
time the officers left. I was on the right of the ditch with Lieut.
Alfred Jennings Bramley, of Tunbridge Wells, as brave a young officer as
ever drew sword, and saw a large force coming out to cut us off. He
said, &quot;Try and shoot the leader. I will run down and tell
Macleod.&quot; The leader was shot, by whom I don&#39;t know. I never
took credit for shooting anyone. Before poor Bramley got down he was
shot in the temple, but not dead. He died during the night.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;">
<img src="images/Scan290.jpg" width="536" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;I RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The captain said, &quot;We can&#39;t leave him. Who
will take him out?&quot; I said, &quot;I will.&quot; The fort was firing
hard all the time. I said, &quot;Eadie, give me a hand. Put him on my
back.&quot; As he was doing so he was shot in the back of the head,
knocking me down, his blood running down my back. A man crawled over and
pulled Eadie off. At this time I thought I was shot, the warm blood
running down my back. The captain said, &quot;We can&#39;t lose any more
lives. Are you wounded?&quot; I said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I
am.&quot; He said, &quot;Will you still take him out?&quot; I said,
&quot;Yes.&quot; He was such a brave young fellow that the company all
loved him. I got him on my back again, and told him to take me tight
round the neck. I ran across the open space. During the time his watch
fell out; I did not like to leave it, so I sat down and picked it up,
all the time under a heavy fire. There was a man of the name of Dods,
who came and took him off my back. I went back again <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
through the same fire, and helped to take up the man Eadie. Then I
returned for my rifle, and firing a volley we all left. It was a badly
managed affair altogether.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;FIGHTING AT THE DOOR.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">At the gallant defence of the fort at Rorke&#39;s
Drift, every man fought like a hero, but some were fortunate enough to
attract the particular attention of their superiors. Among these was a
private of the 24th Regiment, named Robert Jones, who obtained the
Victoria Cross for his conduct on the occasion. His story is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;On the 22nd January, 1879, the Zulus attacked
us, we being only a small band of English soldiers and they in very
strong and overwhelming numbers. On commencing fighting, I was one of
the soldiers who were in the hospital to protect it. I and another
soldier of the name of William Jones were on duty at the back of the
hospital, trying to defeat and drive back the rebels, and doing our
endeavours to convey the wounded and sick soldiers out through a hole in
the wall, so that they might reach in safety the small band of men in
the square. On retiring from one room into another, after taking a
wounded man by the name of Mayer, belonging to the volunteers, to join
William Jones, I found a crowd in front of the hospital and coming into
the doorway. I said to my companion, &#39;They are on top of us,&#39;
and sprang to one side of the doorway. There we crossed our bayonets,
and as fast as they came up to the doorway we bayoneted them, until the
doorway was nearly filled with dead and wounded Zulus. In the meanwhile,
I had three assegai wounds, two in the right side and one in the left of
my body. We did not know of anyone being in the hospital, only the
Zulus, and then after a long time of fighting at the door, we made the
enemy retire, and then we made our escape out of the building. Just as I
got outside, the roof fell in&mdash;a complete mass of flames and fire.
I had to cross a space of about twenty or thirty yards from the ruins of
the hospital to the leagued company where they were keeping the enemy at
bay. While I was crossing the front of the square, the bullets were
whishing past me from every direction. When I got in, the enemy came on
closer and closer, until they were close to the outer side of our
laager, which was made up of boxes of biscuits on sacks of Indian corn.
The fighting lasted about thirteen hours, or better. As to my feelings
at the time, they were that I was certain that if we did not kill them
they would kill us, and after a few minutes&#39; fighting I did not mind
it more than at the present time; my thought was only to fight as an
English soldier ought to for his most gracious Sovereign, Queen
Victoria, and for the benefit of old England.&quot;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gunner James Collis.</span></h3>

<p class="indent">Gunner James Collis tells his story in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">On the twenty-seventh of July, 1880, we were encamped
at Khushk-i-Nakhud, in Afghanistan. At 4 a.m. that day we&mdash;Battery
E, Battery B Brigade&mdash;marched with the rest of the force on Maiwand
to meet Ayub Khan. About 9 a.m. we came in sight of him in position
under the hills. We were on the open plain. Major Henry Blackwood,
commanding my battery, gave the order &quot;Action front.&quot; I was a
limber gunner that day. We began firing with common shell from the right
of the battery. After we had fired a few rounds, their artillery
replied. The first shot struck the near wheel of my gun, killing a
gunner, wounding another, and Lieutenant Fowler.</p>

<p class="indent">The limber box upon my gun was smashed by a shell
which also killed the wheel horses, but did not touch the driver.
Several riding horses of my battery were killed, and a good deal of
damage done to guns and carriage. Four gunners and Sergeant Wood, the
No. 1 of my gun, were killed, and two men wounded, leaving only three
men to work the gun. I took Sergeant Wood&#39;s place.</p>

<p class="indent">At about 1.30 p.m., some of Jacob&#39;s Rifles, who
were lying down about ten yards in rear of the trail, began to be
panic-stricken, and crowded round our guns and carriages, some getting
under the carriages. Three got under my gun. We tried to drive them
away, but it was no use. About that time we ceased firing a little, the
enemy having set the example. During that pause the enemy on the left
got pretty close. To check them, General Nuttall formed up the 3rd
Bombay Cavalry and the 3rd Scinde Horse to charge. Gunner Smith of my
gun, seeing what was going to be done, mounted his horse and joined the
cavalry. General Nuttall led the charge, Gunner Smith being at his side.
After going about 300 yards, the enemy being about 200 yards off, the
whole line, with the exception of the General, the European officers,
and Gunner Smith, turned tail, forming up when in line with the guns.
General Nuttall with the officers, finding themselves deserted,
returned, General Nuttall actually crying from mortification. Gunner
Smith dashed on alone, and was cut down.</p>

<p class="indent">About 4 p.m. a large body of the enemy&#39;s infantry
charged the left of the battery, the men of the left division 5 and 6
being compelled to use their handspikes and charge staves to keep them
off. Major Blackwood on this ordered the battery to limber up and
retire. When Lieutenant Maclaine heard this order he said, as I was
afterwards informed, &quot;Limber up be damned! Give them another
round.&quot; We limbered up and retired at a gallop about 2,000 yards.
In the meantime Major Blackwood remained behind with Lieutenant
Maclaine&#39;s guns and was killed, Lieutenant Osborne by his side,
Lieutenant Maclaine fighting to the last. At length, seeing no use in
stopping, he galloped after us&mdash;we had got separated from the right
division&mdash;and called out to us, only two guns, &quot;Action,
rear.&quot; We fired two rounds with shrapnel. Captain Slade, who had
been in temporary command of the smoothbores, finding Major Blackwood
dead, came up with his smoothbores and took command of all the guns.
Colonel Malcolmson a moment later ordered Captain Slade to retire,
saying, &quot;Captain Slade, if you and the Lieutenant keep those two
guns, he will lose them the same as he has lost his own.&quot; We then
limbered up and went off. Just then a shell burst open our treasure
chest. Many of the troops and camp followers stopped to pick up the
money and were overtaken and killed. Just after that some of the
enemy&#39;s cavalry caught up the guns. One of them wounded me on the
left eyebrow as he passed. He wheeled round and came at me again; I took
my carbine, waited till he was within four or five yards, and let drive,
hitting him on the chest and knocking him off his horse. As he fell his
money fell out of his turban, and Trumpeter Jones jumped off his horse
and picked it up. He escaped, and is now corporal R.H.A., and wears the
Distinguished Service medal for his conduct at Maiwand.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now beginning to get dusk, and I got off to
walk by the side of my gun. Seeing a village close by, and some men at a
well, I followed them and got some water. Just as we got to the well the
enemy charged and drove us off, killing a good many.</p>

<p class="indent">On my return I missed my gun, and picked up with No.
2, which I stuck to till I reached Candahar. It was now dark, and we
were with a stream of men of all regiments, camp followers, camels, and
waggons. Going along I saw a lot of sick and wounded lying by the side
of the road, and I picked them up and put them on the gun and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
limber. I had about ten altogether; they were all 66th men, and a
colonel whose name I do not know and never heard of.</p>

<p class="indent">We had been fighting all day, marching all night and
next day without a bit of food or a drink of water. I did not feel it so
much, as I was so occupied, but I saw several dying by the roadside from
thirst and fatigue. About four in the afternoon of the 28th, we came to
a place called Kokeran, 7-1/2 miles from Candahar; I saw a village where
I could get water for the men who were with me. I went off and brought
the water back and the men with me. On going to the village I saw
Lieutenant Maclaine mounted; when I came back I saw two horses without a
rider. I then went again for more water. I was about 150 yards from the
gun when I saw ten or twelve of the enemy&#39;s cavalry coming on at a
slow pace towards the gun. The gun went off and I lay down and allowed
the gun to pass me, and began firing with a rifle which I had got from a
wounded 66th man, in order to draw their fire upon myself, and stop them
from going forward with the gun. I was concealed in a little nullah, and
I fancy they thought there was more than one man, for they stopped and
fired at me from the saddle. I shot one horse and two men. After firing
about thirty-five rounds General Nuttall came up with some native
cavalry, and drove them off. When I first saw the enemy they were about
300 yards off, when they left they had got 150 yards. General Nuttall
asked me my name, saying, &quot;You&#39;re a gallant young man, what is
your name?&quot; I said, &quot;Gunner Collis, of E. of B, R.H.A.&quot;
He entered it into a pocket-book and rode off. I then followed up my
gun, which I found some 500 yards distant by the side of a river. The
enemy&#39;s fire, which had been going on all the way from Maiwand, now
became hotter, the surrounding hills being full of them. Some of the
garrison of Candahar met us about four miles from the Fort and escorted
us in. I arrived about seven p.m.</p>

<p class="indent">On the occasion of the sortie from Candahar in the
middle of August, 1880, the fighting was going on in the village
situated about 200 yards from the edge of the ditch of the fort. I was
standing by my gun on the rampart, when General Primrose, General
Nuttall, and Colonel Burnet came up. I heard them talking about sending
a message to General Dewberry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
who had succeeded General Brooke, who had been killed. I spoke to
Colonel Burnet and said that I would take the message over the wall.
After a little hesitation General Primrose gave me a note. I was let
down a distance of about thirty or forty feet to the bottom of the ditch
by a rope. When half down I was fired at but not hit by matchlock men
about 250 yards distant, and I scrambled up the open side of the ditch
and ran across to the village. I found the officer commanding in the
middle of it, and fighting going on all round. I delivered the note and
returned. When half way up the rope I was fired at again, one bullet
cutting off the heel of my left boot. General Primrose congratulated me
and Colonel Burnet gave me a drop out of his flask, for what with not
having recovered from the fatigues of Maiwand and the exertion and
excitement of this trip, I was a bit faint.</p>

<p class="indent">I was recommended for the Victoria Cross without my
knowledge about September 10, by Sir F. Roberts, on the report of
General Nuttall and Colonel Burnet. It was given to me July 28, 1881.</p>

<p class="cap">JERRY STOKES was a member of Her Majesty&#39;s civil
service. To put it more plainly, he was the provincial hangman. Not a
man in all Canada, he used to boast with pardonable professional pride,
had turned off as many famous murderers as he had. He was a pillar of
the constitution, was Jerry Stokes. He represented the Executive. And he
wasn&#39;t ashamed of his office, either. Quite on the contrary, zeal
for his vocation shone visible in his face. He called it a useful, a
respectable, and a necessary calling. If it were not for him and his
utensils, he loved to say to the gaping crowd that stood him treat in
the saloons, no man&#39;s life would be safe for a day in the province.
He was a practical philanthropist in his way, a public benefactor. It is
not good that foul crime should stalk unpunished through the land; and
he, Jerry Stokes, was there to prevent it. He was the chosen instrument
for its salutary repression. Executions performed with punctuality and
despatch; for terms, apply to Jeremiah Stokes, Port Hope, Ontario.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan299-2.jpg" width="600" height="650" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;HE WAS A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Not that philanthropy was the most salient
characteristic in Jerry&#39;s outer man. He was a short and thick-set
person, very burly and dogged-looking; he had a massive, square head,
and a powerful lower jaw, and a coarse, bull neck, and a pair of stout
arms, acquired in the lumber trade, but forcibly suggestive of a
prize-fighter&#39;s occupation. Except on the subject of the Executive,
he was a taciturn soul; he had nothing to say, and he said it briefly.
Silence, stolidity, and a marked capacity for the absorption of liquids
without detriment to his centre of gravity, physical or mental, were the
leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
traits in Mr. Stokes&#39; character. Those who knew him well, however,
affirmed that Jerry was &quot;a straight man&quot;; and though the
security was perhaps a trifle doubtful, &quot;a straight man&quot;
nevertheless he was generally considered by all who had the misfortune
to require his services.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a principle with Jerry never to attend a trial
for murder. This showed his natural delicacy of feeling. Etiquette, I
believe, forbids an undertaker to make kind inquiries at the door of a
dying person. It is feared the object of his visits might be
misunderstood; he might be considered to act from interested motives. A
similar and equally creditable scruple restrained Jerry Stokes from
putting in an appearance at a court of justice when a capital charge was
under investigation. People might think, he said, he was on the look-out
for a job. Nay, more; his presence might even interfere with the
administration of justice; for if the jury had happened to spot him in
the body of the hall, it would naturally prejudice them in the
prisoner&#39;s favour. To prevent such a misfortune&mdash;which would of
course, incidentally, be bad for trade&mdash;Mr. Stokes denied himself
the congenial pleasure of following out in detail the cases on which he
might in the end be called upon to operate&mdash;except through the
medium of the public press. He was a kind-hearted man, his friends
averred; and he knew that his presence in court might be distasteful to
the prisoner and the prisoner&#39;s relations. Though, to say the truth,
in thus absenting himself, Mr. Stokes was exercising considerable
self-denial; for to a hangman, even more than to all the rest of the
world, a good first-class murder case is replete with plot-interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/Scan300.jpg" width="424" height="668" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">THE PRISONER.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Every man, however, is guilty at some time or other in
his life of a breach of principle; and once, though once only, in his
professional experience, Jerry Stokes, like the rest of us, gave way to
temptation. To err is human; Jerry erred by attending a capital trial in
Kingston court-house. The case was one that aroused immense attention at
the time in the Dominion. A young lawyer at Napanee, it was said, had
poisoned his wife to inherit her money, and public feeling ran fierce
and strong against him. From the very first, this dead set of public
opinion brought out Jerry Stokes&#39; sympathy in the prisoner&#39;s
favour. The crowd had tried to mob Ogilvy&mdash;that was the man&#39;s
name&mdash;on his way from his house to jail, and again on his journey
from Napanee to Kingston assizes. Men shook their fists angrily in the
face of the accused; women surged around with deep cries, and strove to
tear him to pieces. The police with difficulty prevented the swaying
mass from lynching him on the spot. Jerry Stokes, who was present,
looked on at these irregular proceedings with a disapproving eye. Most
unconstitutional, to dismember a culprit by main force, without form of
trial, instead of handing him over in due course of law to be properly
turned off by the appointed officer!</p>

<p class="indent">So when the trial came on, Jerry Stokes, in defiance
of established etiquette, took his stand in court, and watched the
progress of the case with profound interest.</p>

<p class="indent">The public recognised him, and nudged one another,
well pleased. Farmers had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
driven in with their waggons from the townships. All Ontario was agog.
People stared at Jerry, and then at the prisoner. &quot;Stokes is
looking out for him!&quot; they chuckled in their satisfaction.
&quot;He&#39;s got no chance. He&#39;ll never get off. The hangman&#39;s
in waiting!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The suspected man took his place in the dock. Jerry
Stokes glanced across at him&mdash;rubbed his eyes&mdash;thought it
curious. &quot;Well, I never saw a murderer like him in my born days
afore,&quot; Jerry philosophised to himself. &quot;I&#39;ve turned off
square dozens of &#39;em in my time, in the province; and I know their
looks. But hanged if I&#39;ve come across a murderer yet like this one,
any way!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Richard Ogilvy, stand up: are you guilty or not
guilty?&quot; asked the clerk of assigns.</p>

<p class="indent">And the prisoner, leaning forward, in a very low
voice, but clear and distinct, answered out, &quot;Not Guilty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was a tall and delicate pale-faced man, with
thoughtful grey eyes and a high white forehead. But to Jerry Stokes&#39;
experienced gaze all that counted for nothing. He knew his patients well
enough to know there are murderers and murderers&mdash;the refined and
educated as well as the coarse and brutal. Why, he&#39;d turned off
square dozens of them, and both sorts, too, equally. No; it wasn&#39;t
that&mdash;and he couldn&#39;t say what it was&mdash;but as Richard
Ogilvy answered &quot;Not Guilty&quot; that morning a thrill ran cold
down the hangman&#39;s back. He was sure it was true: he felt
intuitively certain of it.</p>

<p class="indent">From that moment forth, Jerry followed the evidence
with the closest interest. He leaned forward in his place, and drank it
all in anxiously. People who sat near him remarked that his conduct was
disgusting. He was thirsting for a conviction. It was ghastly to see the
hangman so intent upon his prey. He seemed to hang on the lips of the
witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="indent">But Jerry himself sat on, all unconscious of their
criticism. For the very first time in his life, he forgot his trade. He
remembered only that a human soul was at stake that day, and that in one
glimpse of intuition he had seen its innocence.</p>

<p class="indent">Counsel for the Crown piled up a cumulative case, very
strong and conclusive against the man Ogilvy. They showed that the
prisoner had lived on bad terms with his wife&mdash;though through whose
fault they had lived so, whether his or hers, wasn&#39;t very apparent.
They showed that scenes had lately occurred between them. They showed
that Ogilvy had bought poison at a chemist&#39;s in Kingston on the
usual plea, &quot;to get rid of the rats.&quot; They showed that Mrs.
Ogilvy had died of such poison. Their principal witness was the Napanee
doctor, a man named Wade, who attended the deceased in her fatal
illness. This doctor was intelligent, and frank, and straightforward; he
gave his evidence in the most admirable style&mdash;evidence that told
dead against the prisoner in every way. At the close of the case for the
Crown, the game was up: everybody in court said all was finished:
impossible for Ogilvy to rebut such a mass of damning evidence.</p>

<p class="indent">Everybody in court&mdash;except Jerry Stokes. And
Jerry Stokes went home&mdash;for it was a two days&#39; trial&mdash;much
concerned in soul about Richard Ogilvy.</p>

<p class="indent">It was something new for Jerry Stokes, this
disinterested interest in an accused criminal; and it took hold of him
with all the binding and compelling force of a novel emotion. He
wrestled and strained with it. All night long he lay awake, and tossed
and turned on his bed, and thought of Richard Ogilvy&#39;s pale white
face, as he stood there, a picture of mute agony, in the court-house.
Strange thoughts surged up thick in Jerry Stokes&#39; soul, that had
surged up in no other soul among all those actively hostile spectators.
The silent suffering in the man&#39;s grey eyes had stirred him deeply.
A thousand times over, Jerry said to himself, as he tossed and turned,
&quot;That man never done it.&quot; Now and again he dozed off, and
awoke with a start, and each time he woke he found himself muttering in
his sleep, with all the profound force of unreasoned conviction,
&quot;He never done it! he never done it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning, as soon as the court was open, Jerry
Stokes was in his place again, craning his bull-neck eagerly. All day
long he craned that bull-neck and listened. The public was scandalised
now. Jerry Stokes in court! Jerry Stokes scenting blood! He ought to
have kept away! This was really atrocious!</p>

<p class="indent">Evidence for the defence hung fire sadly. To say the
truth, Ogilvy&#39;s counsel had no defence at all to offer, except an
assurance that he didn&#39;t do it. They confined themselves to
suggesting a possible alternative here, and a possible alternative
there. Mrs. Ogilvy might have taken the rat-poison by mistake; or this
person might have given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
it her somehow unawares, or that person might have had some unknown
grudge against her. Jerry Stokes sat and listened with a sickening
heart. The man in the dock was innocent, he felt sure; but the
case&mdash;why, the case was going dead against him!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 552px;">
<img src="images/Scan302.jpg" width="552" height="524" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;JERRY WATCHED HIM CLOSELY.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Slowly, as he listened, an idea began to break in upon
Jerry Stokes&#39; mind. Ideas didn&#39;t often come his way. He was a
thick-headed man, little given to theories, and he didn&#39;t know even
now it was a theory he was forming. He only knew this was the way the
case impressed him. The prisoner at the bar had never done it. But there
had been scenes in his house&mdash;scenes brought about by Mrs.
Ogilvy&#39;s conduct. Mrs. Ogilvy, he felt confident from the evidence
he heard, had been given to drink&mdash;perhaps to other things; and the
prisoner, for his child&#39;s sake (he had one little girl of three
years old), was anxious to screen his wife&#39;s shame from the public.
So he had suggested but little in this direction to his counsel. The
scenes, however, were not of his making, and he certainly never meant to
poison the woman. Jerry Stokes watched him closely as each witness stood
up and told his tale, and he was confident of so much. That twitching of
the lips was no murderer&#39;s trick. It was the plain emotion of an
honest man who sees the circumstances unaccountably turning against
him.</p>

<p class="indent">There was another person in court who watched the case
almost as closely as Jerry himself, and that person was the doctor who
attended Mrs. Ogilvy and made the <i>post-mortem</i>. His steely grey
eyes were fixed with a frank stare on each witness as he detailed his
story; and from time to time he gave a little satisfied gasp, when
anything went obviously against the prisoner&#39;s chances. Jerry was
too much occupied, however, for the most part, in watching the man in
the dock to have any time left for watching the doctor. Once only he
raised his eyes and caught the other&#39;s. It was at a critical moment.
A witness for the defence, under severe cross-examination, had just
admitted a most damaging fact that told hard against Ogilvy. Then the
doctor smiled. It was a sinister smile, a smile of malice, a smile of
mute triumph. No one else noticed it. But Jerry Stokes, looking up,
observed it with a start. A shade passed over his square face like a
sudden cloud. He knew that smile well. It was a typical
murderer&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mind you,&quot; Jerry said to himself, as he
watched the smile die away, &quot;I don&#39;t pretend to be as smart a
chap as all these crack lawyer fellows, but I&#39;m a straight man in my
way, and I know my business. If that doctor ain&#39;t got a
murderer&#39;s face on his front, my name isn&#39;t Jeremiah Stokes;
that&#39;s the long and the short of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked hard at the prisoner, he looked hard at the
doctor. The longer and harder he looked, the more was he sure of it. He
was an expert in murderers, and he knew his men. Ogilvy hadn&#39;t done
it; Ogilvy couldn&#39;t do it; the doctor might; the doctor was, at any
rate, a potential murderer. Not that Jerry put it to himself quite so
fine as that; he contented himself with saying in his own dialect,
&quot;The doctor was one of &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evidence, however, went all against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
prisoner, and the judge, to Jerry&#39;s immense surprise, summed up upon
nothing except the evidence. Nobody in court, indeed, seemed to think of
anything else. Jerry rubbed his eyes once more. He couldn&#39;t
understand it. Why, they were going to hang the man on nothing at all
but the paltry evidence! Professional as he was, it surprised him to
find a man could swing on so little! To think that our lives should
depend on such a thread! Just the gossip of nurses and the tittle-tattle
of a doctor with a smile like a murderer&#39;s!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/Scan303.jpg" width="401" height="487" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;IT WAS A SINISTER SMILE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">At last the jury retired to consider their verdict.
But they were not long gone. The case, said everybody, was as clear as
daylight. In the public opinion it was a foregone conclusion. Jerry
stood aghast at that. What! hang a man merely because they thought
he&#39;d done it! And with a face like his! Why, it was sheer
injustice!</p>

<p class="indent">The jury returned. The prisoner stood in the dock, now
pale and hopeless. Only one man in court seemed to feel the slightest
interest in the delivery of the verdict. And that one man was the public
hangman. Everybody else knew precisely how the case would go. But Jerry
Stokes still refused to believe any jury in Canada could perpetrate such
an act of flagrant injustice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen of the jury, do you find the prisoner,
Richard Ogilvy, Guilty or Not Guilty of wilful murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a slight rhetorical pause. Then the answer
rang out, in quietly solemn tones: &quot;We find him Guilty. That is the
verdict of all of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry Stokes held his breath. This was appalling,
awful! The man was innocent. But by virtue of his office he would have
to hang him!</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="indent">If anybody had told Jerry Stokes the week before that
he possessed an ample, unexhausted fund of natural enthusiasm, Jerry
Stokes would have looked upon him as only fit for Hatwood Asylum. He was
a solid, stolid, thick-headed man, was Jerry, who honestly believed in
the importance of his office, and hanged men as respectably as he would
have slaughtered oxen. But that incredible verdict, as it seemed to him,
begot in him suddenly a fierce outburst of zeal which was all the more
violent because of its utter novelty. For the first time in his life he
woke up to the enthusiasm of humanity. You&#39;ll often find it so in
very phlegmatic men; it takes a great deal to stir their stagnant
depths; but let them once be aroused, and the storm is terrible, the
fire within them burns bright with a warmth and light which astonishes
everybody. For days the look on Richard Ogilvy&#39;s face, when he heard
that false verdict returned against him, haunted the hangman&#39;s brain
every hour of the twenty-four. He lay awake on his bed and shuddered to
think of it. Come what might, that man must never be hanged. And, please
heaven, Jerry added, they should never hang him.</p>

<p class="indent">The sentence, Canadian fashion, was for six clear
weeks. And at the end of that time, unless anything should turn up
meanwhile to prevent it, it would be Jerry&#39;s duty to hang the man he
believed to be innocent.</p>

<p class="indent">For all those years, Jerry had stolidly and soberly
hanged whomever he was bid, taking it for granted the law was always in
the right, and that the men on whom he operated were invariably
malefactors. But now, a great horror possessed his soul. The revulsion
was terrible. This one gross miscarriage of justice, as it seemed to
him, raised doubts at the same time in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
startled soul as to the rightfulness of all his previous hangings. Had
he been in the habit of doing innocent men to death for years? Was the
law, then, always so painfully fallible? Could it go wrong in all the
dignity of its unsullied ermine? Jerry could hang the guilty without one
pang of remorse. But to hang the innocent!&mdash;he drew himself up;
that was altogether a different matter.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet what could he do? A petition? Impossible! Never
within his memory could Jerry recollect so perfect a unanimity of public
opinion in favour of a sentence. A petition was useless. Not a soul
would sign it. Everybody was satisfied. Let Ogilvy swing! The very women
would have lynched the man if they could have caught him at the first.
And now that he was to be hanged, they were heartily glad of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, there is nothing to spur a man on in a hopeless
cause like the feeling that you stand alone and unaided. Jerry Stokes
saw all the world was for hanging Ogilvy&mdash;with the strange and
solitary exception of the public hangman. And what did the public
hangman&#39;s opinion count in such a case? As Jerry Stokes well knew,
rather less than nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">Day after day wore away, and the papers were full of
&quot;the convict Ogilvy.&quot; Would he confess, or would he not? that
was now the question. Every second night the Toronto papers had a
special edition with a &quot;Rumoured Confession of the Napanee
Murderer,&quot; and every second morning they had a telegram direct from
Kingston jail to contradict it. Not a doubt seemed to remain with
anybody as to the convict&#39;s guilt. But the papers reiterated daily
the same familiar phrase, &quot;Ogilvy persists to the end in
maintaining his innocence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry had read these words a hundred times before,
about other prisoners, with a gentle smile of cynical incredulity; he
read them now with blank amazement and horror at the callousness of a
world which could hang an innocent man without appeal or inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">Time ran on, and the eve of the execution arrived at
last. Something must be done: and Jerry did it. That night he sat long
in his room by himself, in the unwonted throes of literary composition.
He was writing a letter&mdash;a letter of unusual length and surprising
earnestness. It cost him dear, that epistle; with his dictionary by his
side, he stopped many times to think, and bit his penholder to fibre.
But he wrote none the less with fiery indignation, and in a fever of
moral zeal that positively astonished himself. Then he copied it out
clean on a separate sheet, and folded the letter when done, with a
prayer in his heart. It was a prayer for mercy on a condemned
criminal&mdash;by the public hangman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 483px;">
<img src="images/Scan304.jpg" width="483" height="503" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;IT COST HIM DEAR, THAT EPISTLE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">After that he stuck a stamp on with trembling fingers,
and posted it himself at the main office.</p>

<p class="indent">All that night long Jerry lay awake and thought about
the execution. As a rule, executions troubled his rest very little. But
then, he had never before had to hang an innocent man&mdash;at least he
hoped not&mdash;though his faith in the law had received a severe shock,
and he trembled to think now what judicial murders he might have helped
in his time unconsciously to consummate.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning early, at the appointed hour, Jerry
Stokes presented himself at Kingston jail. The sheriff was there, and
the chaplain, and the prisoner. Ogilvy looked at him hard with a
shrinking look of horror. Jerry had seen that look, too, a hundred times
before, and disregarded it utterly: it was only the natural objection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
of a condemned criminal to the constitutional officer appointed to
operate on him. But this time it cut the man to the very quick. That an
innocent fellow-creature should regard him like that was indeed
unendurable, especially when he, the public hangman, was the only soul
on earth who believed in his innocence!</p>

<p class="indent">The chaplain stood forward and read the usual prayers.
The condemned man repeated them after him in a faltering voice. As he
finished, the sheriff turned with a grave face to Jerry. &quot;Do your
duty,&quot; he said. And Jerry stared at him stolidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sheriff,&quot; he began at last, after a very
long pause, bracing himself up for an effort, &quot;I&#39;ve done my
duty all my life till this, and I&#39;ll do it now. There ain&#39;t
going to be no execution at all here this morning!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sheriff gazed at him astonished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean, Stokes?&quot; he asked, taken
aback at this sudden turn. &quot;No reprieve has come. The prisoner is
to be hanged without fail to-day in accordance with his sentence. It
says so in the warrant: &#39;wherein fail not at your
peril.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry looked round him with an air of expectation.
&quot;No reprieve hasn&#39;t come yet,&quot; he answered, in a stolid
way; &quot;but I&#39;m expecting one presently. I&#39;ve done my duty
all my life, sheriff, I tell you, and I&#39;ll do it now. I ain&#39;t
a-going to hang this man at all&mdash;because I know he&#39;s
innocent.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan305.jpg" width="600" height="485" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;I AIN&#39;T A-GOING TO HANG THIS MAN.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The prisoner gasped, and turned round to him in amaze.
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m innocent!&quot; he said slowly, looking him over from
head to foot; &quot;but you&mdash;how do you know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it by your face,&quot; Jerry answered
sturdily; &quot;and I know by the other one&#39;s face it was him that
did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sheriff looked on in puzzled wonderment. This was
a hitch in the proceedings he had never expected. &quot;Your conduct is
most irregular, Stokes,&quot; he said at last, stroking his chin in his
embarrassment; &quot;most irregular and disconcerting. If you had a
conscientious scruple against hanging the prisoner, you should have told
us before. Then we might have arranged for some other executioner to
serve in your place. As it is, the delay is most unseemly and painful:
especially for the prisoner. Your action can only cause him unnecessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
suspense. Sooner or later this morning, somebody must hang
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Jerry only looked back at him with an approving
nod. The sheriff had supplied him, all inarticulate that he was, with
suitable speech. &quot;Ah, that&#39;s just it, don&#39;t you see,&quot;
he made answer promptly, &quot;it&#39;s a conscientious scruple.
That&#39;s why I won&#39;t hang him. No man can&#39;t be expected to go
agin his conscience. I never hanged an innocent man yet&mdash;least-ways
not to my knowledge; and s&#39;help me heaven, I won&#39;t hang one now,
not for the Queen nor for nobody!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sheriff paused. The sheriff deliberated.
&quot;What on earth am I to do?&quot; he exclaimed, in despair. &quot;If
<i>you</i> won&#39;t hang him, how on earth at this hour can I secure a
substitute?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry stared at him stolidly once more, after his
wont. &quot;If <i>I</i> don&#39;t hang him,&quot; he answered, with the
air of one who knows his ground well, &quot;it&#39;s <i>your</i>
business to do it with your own hands. &#39;Wherein fail not at your
peril.&#39; And I give you warning beforehand, sheriff, if you <i>do</i>
hang him&mdash;why, you&#39;ll have to remember all your life long that
you helped to get rid of an innocent man, when the common hangman
refused to execute him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To such a pitch of indignation was he roused by events
that he said it plump out, just so, &quot;the common hangman.&quot;
Rather than let his last appeal lack aught of effectiveness in the cause
of justice, he consented so to endorse the public condemnation of his
own respectable, useful, and necessary calling!</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause of a few minutes, during which the
sheriff once more halted and hesitated; the prisoner looked around with
a pale and terrified air; and Jerry kept his eye fixed hard on the gate,
like one who really expects a reprieve or a pardon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you absolutely refuse?&quot; the sheriff
asked at last, in a despairing sort of way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I absolutely refuse,&quot; Jerry answered, in a
very decided tone. But it was clear he was beginning to grow anxious and
nervous.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case,&quot; the sheriff replied, turning
round to the jailor, &quot;I must put off this execution for half an
hour, till I can get someone else to come in and assist me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hardly had he spoken the words, however, when a
policeman appeared at the door of the courtyard, and in a very hurried
voice asked eagerly to be admitted. His manner was that of a man who
brings important news. &quot;The execution&#39;s not over, sir?&quot; he
said, turning to the sheriff with a very scared face. &quot;Well, thank
heaven for that! Dr. Wade&#39;s outside, and he says, for God&#39;s
sake, he must speak at once with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sheriff hesitated. He hardly knew what to do.
&quot;Bring him in,&quot; he said at last, after a solemn pause.
&quot;He may have something to tell us that will help us out of this
difficulty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The condemned man, thus momentarily respited on the
very brink of the grave, stood by with a terrible look of awed suspense
upon his bloodless face. But Jerry Stokes&#39; lips bore an expression
of quiet triumph. He had succeeded in his attempt, then. He had brought
his man to book. That was something to be proud of. Alone he had done
it! He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
had saved the innocent and exposed the guilty!</p>

<p class="indent">As they stood there and pondered, each man in silence,
on his own private thoughts, the policeman returned, bringing with him
the doctor whose evidence had weighed most against Ogilvy at the trial.
Jerry Stokes started to see the marvellous alteration in the
fellow&#39;s face. He was pale and haggard; his lips were parched; and
his eyes had a sunken and hollow look with remorse and horror. Cold
sweat stood on his brow. His mouth twitched horribly. It was clear he
had just passed through a terrible crisis.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/Scan306.jpg" width="468" height="694" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;HE WAS PALE AND HAGGARD.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">He turned first to Jerry. His lips were bloodless, and
trembled as he spoke; his throat was dry; but in a husky voice he still
managed to deliver himself of the speech that haunted him. &quot;Your
letter did it,&quot; he said slowly, fixing his eyes on the hangman;
&quot;I couldn&#39;t stand <i>that</i>. It broke me down utterly. All
night long I lay awake and knew I had sent him to the gallows in my
place. It was terrible&mdash;terrible! But I wouldn&#39;t give way:
I&#39;d made up my mind, and I meant to pull through with it. Then the
morning came&mdash;the morning of the execution, and with it your
letter. Till that moment I thought nobody knew but myself. I wasn&#39;t
even suspected. When I saw <i>you</i> knew, I could stand it no longer.
You said: &#39;If you let this innocent man swing in your place, I, the
common hangman, will refuse to execute him. If he dies, I&#39;ll avenge
him. I&#39;ll hound you to your grave. I&#39;ll follow up clues till
I&#39;ve brought your crime home to you. Don&#39;t commit two murders
instead of one. It&#39;ll do you no good, and be worse in the end for
you.&#39; When I read those words&mdash;those terrible words!&mdash;from
the common hangman, &#39;Ah, heaven!&#39; I thought, &#39;I need try to
conceal it no longer.&#39; All&#39;s up now. I&#39;ve come to confess.
Thank heaven I&#39;m in time! Sheriff, let this man go. It was I who
poisoned her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a dead silence again for several seconds.
Jerry Stokes was the first of them all to break it. &quot;I knew
it,&quot; he said solemnly. &quot;I was sure of it. I could have sworn
to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am sure of it, too,&quot; the condemned
man put in, with tremulous lips. &quot;I was sure it was he; but how on
earth was I to prove it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sheriff looked about him at all three in turn.
&quot;Well,&quot; he said deliberately, with a sigh of relief, &quot;I
must telegraph for instructions to Ottawa immediately. Prisoner, you are
<i>not</i> reprieved; but under these peculiar circumstances, as Dr.
Wade makes a voluntary confession of having committed the crime himself,
I defer the execution for the present on my own responsibility. Jailer,
I remit Mr. Ogilvy to the cells till further instructions arrive from
the Viceroy. Policeman, take charge of Dr. Wade, who gives himself into
custody for the murder of Mrs. Ogilvy. Stokes, perhaps you did right
after all. Ten minutes&#39; delay made all the difference. If you&#39;d
consented to hang the prisoner at first, this confession might only have
come after all was over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor turned to Jerry, with the wan ghost of a
grim smile upon his worn and pallid face. The marks of a great struggle
were still visible in every line. &quot;And you won&#39;t be baulked of
your fee, after all,&quot; he added, with a ghastly effort at cynical
calmness; &quot;for you&#39;ll have <i>me</i> to hang before you have
seen the end of this business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Jerry shook his head. &quot;I ain&#39;t so sure
about that,&quot; he said, scratching his thick, bullet poll, and
holding his great square neck a little on one side. &quot;I ain&#39;t so
sure of my trade as I used to be once, sheriff and gentlemen. I always
used to hold it was a useful, a respectable, and a necessary trade, and
of benefit to the community. But I&#39;ve began to doubt it. If the law
can string up an innocent man like this, and no appeal, except for the
exertions of the public executioner, why, I&#39;ve began to doubt the
expediency, so to speak, of capital punishment. I ain&#39;t so certain
as I was about the usefulness of hanging. Dr. Wade, I think somebody
else may have the turning of you off. Mr. Ogilvy, I&#39;m glad, sir, it
was me that had the hanging of you. An unscrupulous man might ha&#39;
gone for his fee. I couldn&#39;t do that: I gone for justice. Give me
your hand, sir. Thank you. You needn&#39;t be ashamed of shaking hands
once in a way with a public functionary&mdash;especially when it&#39;s
for the last time in his official career. Sheriff, I&#39;ve had enough
of this &#39;ere work for life. I go back to the lumbering trade. I
resign my appointment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a great speech for Jerry&mdash;an oratorical
effort. But a prouder or happier man there wasn&#39;t in Kingston that
day than Jeremiah Stokes, late public executioner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">[François Coppée, who was born in January, 1842, is
known chiefly as a poet, and is, indeed, considered by some critics as
the greatest poet now alive in France. For many years he acted as
librarian to the Senate, but since 1878 he has held the post of Keeper
of the Records at the Comédie-Française, at which theatre several of his
plays have been produced. His poems have gained for him the glory of the
Legion of Honour; but his short prose tales are full of the same fine
qualities which are conspicuous in his verse.]</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Scan308-1.jpg" alt="N" width="115" height="116" class="cap" />
<p class="cap">WHEN Lucien Hem saw his last hundred-franc note gripped
by the bank-keeper&#39;s rake, and rose from the roulette-table, where
he had lost the last fragments of his little fortune, collected for this
supreme struggle, he felt giddy, and thought he was going to fall.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">With dizzy head and tottering legs, he went and threw
himself down upon the broad leathern settee surrounding the
play-table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/Scan308-2.jpg" width="471" height="657" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;HE FELT GIDDY.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">For some minutes he gazed vacantly on the clandestine
gambling-house in which he had squandered the best years of his youth;
recognised the ravaged faces of the gamblers, crudely lit by the three
large shaded lamps; listened to the light jingle of gold on the
cloth-covered table; felt that he was ruined, lost; recollected that he
had at home the pair of regulation pistols which his father, General
Hem, then a simple captain, had used so well in the attack of Zaatcha;
then, overcome by fatigue, he sank into a profound sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">When he arose, with a clammy mouth, he saw by the
clock that he had slept for barely half an hour, and felt an imperious
need for breathing the night air. The clock-hands marked a quarter
before midnight. While rising and stretching his arms, Lucien remembered
that it was Christmas Eve, and, by an ironic trick of memory, he saw
himself a little child, putting its shoes into the chimney before going
to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment old Dronski&mdash;a pillar of the
gaming house, the classic Pole, wearing the threadbare hooded woollen
cloak, ornamented all over with grease stains&mdash;approached Lucien,
and muttered a few words in his grizzled beard: &quot;Lend me a
five-franc piece, monsieur. It&#39;s now two days since I have stirred
out of the club, and for two days the &#39;seventeen&#39; has never
turned up. Laugh at me, if you like, but I&#39;ll suffer my hand to be
cut off if that number does not turn up on the stroke of
midnight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lucien Hem shrugged his shoulders. He had not even
enough in his pocket to meet this tax, which the frequenters of the
place called &quot;The Pole&#39;s hundred sous.&quot; He passed into the
antechamber, took his hat and fur coat, and descended the stairs with
feverish rapidity.</p>

<p class="indent">Since four o&#39;clock, when Lucien had shut himself
up in the gaming-house, snow had fallen heavily, and the street&mdash;a
street in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
centre of Paris, very narrow, and built with high houses on either
side&mdash;was completely white.</p>

<p class="indent">In the calm sky, blue-black, the cold stars
glittered.</p>

<p class="indent">The ruined gambler shuddered under his furs, and
walked away, his mind still teeming with thoughts of despair, and more
than ever turning to the remembrance of the box of pistols which awaited
him in one of his drawers; but after moving forward a few steps, he
stopped suddenly before a heart-wringing sight.</p>

<p class="indent">On a stone bench, placed according to old custom near
the monumental door of a mansion, a little girl of six or seven years of
age, dressed in a ragged black frock, was sitting in the snow. She was
sleeping, in spite of the cruel cold, in an attitude of frightful
fatigue and exhaustion: her poor little head and tiny shoulder pressed
as if they had sunk into an angle of the wall, and reposing on the icy
stone. One of her wooden shoes had fallen from her foot, which hung
helplessly and lugubriously before her.</p>

<p class="indent">With a mechanical gesture, Lucien put his hand to his
waistcoat pocket, but a moment afterwards he recollected that he had not
been able to find even a forgotten piece of twenty-sous, and had been
obliged to leave the club without giving the customary &quot;tip&quot;
to the club attendant; yet, moved by an instinctive feeling of pity, he
approached the little girl, and might, perhaps, have taken her in his
arms and given her a night&#39;s lodging, when in the wooden shoe which
had slipped from her foot he saw something glitter.</p>

<p class="indent">He stooped: it was a gold coin.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="indent">Some charitable person, doubtless some lady, had
passed by, had seen on this Christmas night the little wooden shoe lying
in front of the sleeping child, and, recalling the touching legend, had
placed there, with a secret hand, a magnificent offering, so that this
poor abandoned one might believe in presents made for the infant
Saviour, and preserve, in spite of her misfortune, some confidence and
some hope in the goodness of Providence.</p>

<p class="indent">A gold piece! It was several days of rest and riches
for the beggar, and Lucien was on the point of waking her to tell her
this, when he heard near his ear, as in an hallucination, a
voice&mdash;the voice of the Pole, with its coarse drawling accent,
almost whispering: &quot;It&#39;s now two days since I stirred out of
the club, and for two days the &#39;seventeen&#39; has never turned up;
I&#39;ll suffer my hand to be cut off, if that number does not turn up
on the stroke of midnight.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 542px;">
<img src="images/Scan309.jpg" width="542" height="666" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;HE STOLE THE GOLD PIECE FROM THE
FALLEN SHOE!&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then this young man of three-and-twenty, descended
from a race of honest men, who bore a proud military name, and who had
never swerved from the path of honour, conceived a frightful idea; he
was seized with a mad, hysterical, monstrous desire. After glancing on
all sides, to make sure that he was alone in the deserted street, he
bent his knee, and carefully out-stretching his trembling hand, he stole
the gold piece from the fallen shoe!</p>

<p class="indent">Hurrying then, with all his speed, he returned to the
gambling-house, scaled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
stairs two and three at a stride, and entering the accursed play-room as
the first stroke of midnight was sounding, placed the piece of gold on
the green cloth, and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I stake on the seventeen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The seventeen won.</p>

<p class="indent">With a turn of the hand Lucien pushed the thirty-six
louis on to the &quot;red.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;red&quot; won.</p>

<p class="indent">He left the seventy-two louis on the same colour; the
&quot;red&quot; again won.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px;">
<img src="images/Scan310.jpg" width="546" height="684" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;AND STILL HE WON.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Twice he &quot;doubled&quot;&mdash;three
times&mdash;always with the same success. He had now before him a pile
of gold and notes, and began to scatter stakes all over the board; the
&quot;dozen,&quot; the &quot;column,&quot; the &quot;number,&quot; all
the combinations succeeded with him. His luck was unheard of,
supernatural. It might have been imagined that the little ivory ball
dancing in the roulette was magnetised, fascinated by the eyes of this
player and obedient to him. In a dozen stakes he had recovered the few
wretched thousand-franc notes, his last resources, which he had lost at
the beginning of the evening.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, punting with two or three hundred louis at a
time, and aided by his fantastic vein of luck, he was on the way to
regaining, and more besides, the hereditary capital he had squandered in
so few years, and reconstituting his fortune.</p>

<p class="indent">In his eagerness to return to the gaming-table, he had
not taken off his fur coat. Already he had crammed the large pockets
with bundles of notes and rouleaux of gold pieces; and, not knowing
where to heap his winnings, he now loaded the inner and exterior pockets
of his frock-coat, the pockets of his waistcoat and trousers, his
cigar-case, his handkerchief&mdash;everything that could be made to hold
his money.</p>

<p class="indent">And still he played, and still he won, like a madman,
like a drunken man! And he threw handfuls of louis on to the
&quot;picture,&quot; at hazard, with a gesture of certainty and
disdain!</p>

<p class="indent">Only something like a red-hot iron was in his heart,
and he thought of nothing but of the little mendicant sleeping in the
snow whom he had robbed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she still at the same spot! Surely she must
be still there! Presently&mdash;yes, when one o&#39;clock
strikes&mdash;I swear it! I will quit this place. I will take her
sleeping in my arms and carry her to my home; I will put her into my
warm bed; I will bring her up, give her a dowry, love her as if she were
my own daughter, care for her always, always!&quot;</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="indent">But the clock struck one, and then a quarter, and then
a half, and then three-quarters.</p>

<p class="indent">And Lucien was still seated at the infernal table.</p>

<p class="indent">At length, one minute before two o&#39;clock, the
keeper of the bank rose abruptly, and said in a loud voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bank is broken, gentlemen&mdash;enough for
to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a bound Lucien was on his feet. Roughly pushing
aside the gamblers who surrounded him and regarded him with envious
admiration, he hurried away quickly, sprang down the stairs and ran all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"> </a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
the way to the stone bench. In the distance, by the light of a lamp, he
saw the little girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God be praised!&quot; he said; &quot;she is
still there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He approached her, he took her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! how cold she is, poor little one!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took her under the arms and raised her, so that he
might carry her; her head fell back without her awaking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How soundly children of her age sleep!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pressed her against his bosom to warm her, and,
seized by a vague inquietude, and, with a view to rousing her out of
this heavy slumber, he kissed her eyelids.</p>

<p class="indent">Then it was that he perceived with terror that these
eyelids were half open, showing half the eyeballs&mdash;glassy,
lightless, motionless. Upon his brain flashed a horrible suspicion. He
placed his mouth close to that of the little girl; no breath came from
it.</p>

<p class="indent">While with the gold piece which he had stolen from
this mendicant, Lucien had won a fortune at the gaming table, the
homeless child had died&mdash;died of cold!</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p class="indent">Seized by the throat by the most frightful of agonies,
Lucien tried to utter a cry, and, in the effort which he made, awoke
from his nightmare on the club settee, on which he had gone to sleep a
little before midnight, and where the attendant who had quitted the
house last had left him out of charity.</p>

<p class="indent">The misty dawn of a December morning was greying the
window-panes.</p>

<p class="indent">Lucien went out into the street, pledged his watch,
took a bath, breakfasted, and then went to the recruiting-office, and
signed an engagement as volunteer in the 1st Regiment of Chasseurs
d&#39;Afrique.</p>

<p class="indent">At the present time Lucien Hem is a lieutenant; he has
only his pay to live upon, but he contrives to make it suffice, being a
very steady officer and never touching a card. It appears even that he
has found the means of saving, for the other day, at Algiers, one of his
comrades who was following him, at a few paces distant, in one of the
hilly streets of the Kasba, saw him give something in charity to a
little Spanish girl sleeping in a doorway, and had the indiscretion to
see what it was that Lucien had given to the child.</p>

<p class="indent">Great was his surprise at the poor lieutenant&#39;s
generosity.</p>

<p class="indent">Lucien Hem had put into the hand of the poor child a
<i>piece of gold</i>!</p>

of quite remarkable scientific attainments. As honorary secretary of the

never-failing brilliance. It was even whispered that on the occasion of
the delivery of Professor Tomlinson&#39;s suggestive lecture &quot;On
the Perigenesis of the Plastidule&quot; she was the only woman in the
room who could follow the lecturer even as far as the end of his title.
In the seclusion of the Lindens she supported Darwin, laughed at Mivart,
doubted Haeckel, and shook her head at Weissman, with a familiarity
which made her the admiration of the University professors and the
terror of the few students who ventured to cross her learned but
hospitable threshold. Mrs. Esdaile had, of course, detractors. It is the
privilege of exceptional merit. There were bitter feminine whispers as
to the cramming from encyclopædias and text-books which preceded each
learned meeting, and as to the care with which in her own house the
conversation was artfully confined to those particular channels with
which the hostess was familiar. Tales there were, too, of brilliant
speeches written out in some masculine hand, which had been committed to
memory by the ambitious lady, and had afterwards flashed out as
extempore elucidations of some dark, half-explored corner of modern
science. It was even said that these little blocks of information got
jumbled up occasionally in their bearer&#39;s mind, so that after an
entomological lecture she would burst into a geological harangue, or
<i>vice versâ</i>, to the great confusion of her audience. So ran the
gossip of the malicious, but those who knew her best were agreed that
she was a very charming and clever little person.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;SCIENTIFIC PROOF.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">It would have been a strange thing had Mrs. Esdaile
not been popular among local scientists, for her pretty house, her
charming grounds, and all the hospitality which an income of two
thousand a year will admit of, were always at their command. On her
pleasant lawns in the summer, and round her drawing-room fire in the
winter, there was much high talk of microbes, and leucocytes, and
sterilised bacteria, where thin, ascetic materialists from the
University upheld the importance of this life against round, comfortable
champions of orthodoxy from the Cathedral Close. And in the heat of
thrust and parry, when scientific proof ran full tilt against inflexible
faith, a word from the clever widow, or an opportune rattle over the
keys by her pretty daughter Rose, would bring all back to harmony once
more.</p>

<p class="indent">Rose Esdaile had just passed her twentieth year, and
was looked upon as one of the beauties of Birchespool. Her face was,
perhaps, a trifle long for perfect symmetry, but her eyes were fine, her
expression kindly, and her complexion beautiful. It was an open secret,
too, that she had under her father&#39;s will five hundred a year in her
own right. With such advantages a far plainer girl than Rose Esdaile
might create a stir in the society of a provincial town.</p>

<p class="indent">A scientific conversazione in a private house is an
onerous thing to organise, yet mother and daughter had not shrunk from
the task. On the morning of which I write, they sat together surveying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
their accomplished labours, with the pleasant feeling that nothing
remained to be done save to receive the congratulations of their
friends. With the assistance of Rupert, the son of the house, they had
assembled from all parts of Birchespool objects of scientific interest,
which now adorned the long tables in the drawing-room. Indeed, the full
tide of curiosities of every sort which had swelled into the house had
overflowed the rooms devoted to the meeting, and had surged down the
broad stairs to invade the dining-room and the passage. The whole villa
had become a museum. Specimens of the flora and fauna of the Philippine
Islands, a ten-foot turtle carapace from the Gallapagos, the os frontis
of the Bos montis as shot by Captain Charles Beesly in the Thibetan
Himalayas, the bacillus of Koch cultivated on gelatine&mdash;these and a
thousand other such trophies adorned the tables upon which the two
ladies gazed that morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve really managed it splendidly,
ma,&quot; said the young lady, craning her neck up to give her mother a
congratulatory kiss. &quot;It was so brave of you to undertake
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that it will do,&quot; purred Mrs.
Esdaile complacently. &quot;But I do hope that the phonograph will work
without a hitch. You know at the last meeting of the British Association
I got Professor Standerton to repeat into it his remarks on the life
history of the Medusiform Gonophore.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How funny it seems,&quot; exclaimed Rose,
glancing at the square box-like apparatus, which stood in the post of
honour on the central table, &quot;to think that this wood and metal
will begin to speak just like a human being.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hardly that, dear. Of course the poor thing can
say nothing except what is said to it. You always know exactly what is
coming. But I do hope that it will work all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rupert will see to it when he comes up from the
garden. He understands all about them. Oh, ma, I feel so
nervous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Esdaile looked anxiously down at her daughter,
and passed her hand caressingly over her rich brown hair. &quot;I
understand,&quot; she said, in her soothing, cooing voice, &quot;I
understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will expect an answer to-night, ma.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Follow your heart, child. I am sure that I have
every confidence in your good sense and discretion. I would not dictate
to you upon such a matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are so good, ma. Of course, as Rupert says,
we really know very little of Charles&mdash;of Captain Beesly. But then,
ma, all that we do know is in his favour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so, dear. He is musical, and
well-informed, and good-humoured, and certainly extremely handsome. It
is clear, too, from what he says, that he has moved in the very highest
circles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The best in India, ma. He was an intimate friend
of the Governor-General&#39;s. You heard yourself what he said yesterday
about the D&#39;Arcies, and Lady Gwendoline Fairfax, and Lord Montague
Grosvenor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, dear,&quot; said Mrs. Esdaile resignedly,
&quot;you are old enough to know your own mind. I shall not attempt to
dictate to you. I own that my own hopes were set upon Professor
Stares.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, ma, think how dreadfully ugly he
is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But think of his reputation, dear. Little more
than thirty, and a member of the Royal Society.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t, ma. I don&#39;t think I could,
if there was not another man in the world. But, oh, I do feel so
nervous; for you can&#39;t think how earnest he is. I must give him an
answer to-night. But they will be here in an hour. Don&#39;t you think
that we had better go to our rooms?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two ladies had risen, when there came a quick
masculine step upon the stairs, and a brisk young fellow, with curly
black hair, dashed into the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All ready?&quot; he asked, running his eyes over
the lines of relic-strewn tables.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All ready, dear,&quot; answered his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I am glad to catch you together,&quot; said
he, with his hands buried deeply in his trouser pockets, and an uneasy
expression on his face. &quot;There&#39;s one thing that I wanted to
speak to you about. Look here, Rosie; a bit of fun is all very well; but
you wouldn&#39;t be such a little donkey to think seriously of this
fellow Beesly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Rupert, do try to be a little less
abrupt,&quot; said Mrs. Esdaile, with a deprecating hand
outstretched.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t help seeing how they have been
thrown together. I don&#39;t want to be unkind, Rosie; but I can&#39;t
stand by and see you wreck your life for a man who has nothing to
recommend him but his eyes and his moustache. Do be a sensible girl,
Rosie, and have nothing to say to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is surely a point, Rupert, upon which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
I am more fitted to decide than you can be,&quot; remarked Mrs. Esdaile,
with dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, mater, for I have been able to make some
inquiries. Young Cheffington, of the Gunners, knew him in India. He
says&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But his sister broke in upon his revelations. &quot;I
won&#39;t stay here, ma, to hear him slandered behind his back,&quot;
she cried, with spirit. &quot;He has never said anything that was not
kind of you, Rupert, and I don&#39;t know why you should attack him so.
It is cruel, unbrotherly.&quot; With a sweep and a whisk she was at the
door, her cheek flushed, her eyes sparkling, her bosom heaving with this
little spurt of indignation, while close at her heels walked her mother
with soothing words, and an angry glance thrown back over her shoulder.
Rupert Esdaile stood with his hands burrowing deeper and deeper into his
pockets, and his shoulders rising higher and higher to his ears, feeling
intensely guilty, and yet not certain whether he should blame himself
for having said too much or for not having said enough.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan314.jpg" width="600" height="566" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;I WON&#39;T STAY HERE TO HEAR HIM SLANDERED.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Just in front of him stood the table on which the
phonograph, with wires, batteries, and all complete, stood ready for the
guests whom it was to amuse. Slowly his hands emerged from his pockets
as his eye fell upon the apparatus, and with languid curiosity he
completed the connection, and started the machine. A pompous, husky
sound, as of a man clearing his throat proceeded from the instrument,
and then in high, piping tones, thin but distinct, the commencement of
the celebrated scientist&#39;s lecture. &quot;Of all the interesting
problems,&quot; remarked the box, &quot;which are offered to us by
recent researches into the lower orders of marine life, there is none to
exceed the retrograde metamorphosis which characterises the common
barnacle. The differentiation of an amorphous protoplasmic
mass&mdash;&quot; Here Rupert Esdaile broke the connection again, and
the funny little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
tinkling voice ceased as suddenly as it began.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man stood smiling, looking down at this
garrulous piece of wood and metal, when suddenly the smile broadened,
and a light of mischief danced up into his eyes. He slapped his thigh,
and danced round in the ecstasy of one who has stumbled on a brand-new
brilliant idea. Very carefully he drew forth the slips of metal which
recorded the learned Professor&#39;s remarks, and laid them aside for
future use. Into the slots he thrust virgin plates, all ready to receive
an impression, and then, bearing the phonograph under his arm, he
vanished into his own sanctum. Five minutes before the first guests had
arrived the machine was back upon the table, and all ready for use.</p>

<p class="indent">There could be no question of the success of Mrs.
Esdaile&#39;s conversazione. From first to last everything went
admirably. People stared through microscopes, and linked hands for
electric shocks, and marvelled at the Gallapagos turtle, the os frontis
of the Bos montis, and all the other curiosities which Mrs. Esdaile had
taken such pains to collect. Groups formed and chatted round the various
cases. The Dean of Birchespool listened with a protesting lip, while
Professor Maunders held forth upon a square of triassic rock, with
side-thrusts occasionally at the six days of orthodox creation; a knot
of specialists disputed over a stuffed ornithorhynchus in a corner;
while Mrs. Esdaile swept from group to group, introducing,
congratulating, laughing, with the ready, graceful tact of a clever
woman of the world. By the window sat the heavily-moustached Captain
Beesly, with the daughter of the house, and they discussed a problem of
their own, as old as the triassic rock, and perhaps as little
understood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I must really go and help my mother to
entertain, Captain Beesly,&quot; said Rose at last, with a little
movement as if to rise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t go, Rose. And don&#39;t call me
Captain Beesly; call me Charles. Do, now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, Charles.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/Scan315.jpg" width="575" height="700"
alt="Call me Charles. Do now."
title="Call me Charles. Do now." />
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;How prettily it sounds from your lips! No, now,
don&#39;t go. I can&#39;t bear to be away from you. I had heard of love,
Rose; but how strange it seems that I, after spending my life amid all
that is sparkling and gay, should only find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
now, in this little provincial town, what love really is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say so; but it is only a passing
fancy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed. I shall never leave you,
Rose&mdash;never, unless you drive me away from your side. And you would
not be so cruel&mdash;you would not break my heart?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had very plaintive, blue eyes, and there was such a
depth of sorrow in them as he spoke that Rose could have wept for
sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should be very sorry to cause you grief in any
way,&quot; she said, in a faltering tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then promise&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no; we cannot speak of it just now, and they
are collecting round the phonograph. Do come and listen to it. It is so
funny. Have you ever heard one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will amuse you immensely. And I am sure that
you would never guess what it is going to talk about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I won&#39;t tell you. You shall hear. Let us
have these chairs by the open door; it is so nice and cool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The company had formed an expectant circle round the
instrument. There was a subdued hush as Rupert Esdaile made the
connection, while his mother waved her white hand slowly from left to
right to mark the cadence of the sonorous address which was to break
upon their ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How about Lucy Araminta Pennyfeather?&quot;
cried a squeaky little voice. There was a rustle and a titter among the
audience. Rupert glanced across at Captain Beesly. He saw a drooping
jaw, two protruding eyes, and a face the colour of cheese.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan316.jpg" width="600" height="624" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;WHO WAS IT WHO HID THE ACE?&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
&quot;How about little Martha Hovedean of the Kensal Choir Union?&quot;
cried the piping voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Louder still rose the titters. Mrs. Esdaile stared
about her in bewilderment. Rose burst out laughing, and the
Captain&#39;s jaw drooped lower still, with a tinge of green upon the
cheese-like face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who was it who hid the ace in the artillery
card-room at Peshawur? Who was it who was broke in consequence? Who was
it&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried Mrs. Esdaile,
&quot;what nonsense is this? The machine is out of order. Stop it,
Rupert. These are not the Professor&#39;s remarks. But, dear me, where
is our friend Captain Beesly gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid that he is not very well, ma,&quot;
said Rose. &quot;He rushed out of the room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There can&#39;t be much the matter,&quot; quoth
Rupert. &quot;There he goes, cutting down the avenue as fast as his legs
will carry him. I do not think, somehow, that we shall see the Captain
again. But I must really apologise. I have put in the wrong slips.
These, I fancy, are those which belong to Professor Standerton&#39;s
lecture.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Rose Esdaile has become Rose Stares now, and her
husband is one of the most rising scientists in the provinces. No doubt
she is proud of his intellect and of his growing fame, but there are
times when she still gives a thought to the blue-eyed Captain, and
marvels at the strange and sudden manner in which he deserted her.</p>

<i>Camille.</i></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From the French of Alfred de Musset.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">[Alfred de Musset was born in the middle of old Paris,
in the year 1810. Musset is the Byron of the French; but at the age when
Byron was playing cricket in the grounds of Harrow, Alfred and his
brother Paul were poring day and night over old romances, and dressing
themselves up as knights and robbers, to represent the characters of
whom they read. At nineteen he began to write, and, unlike Byron, his
first book of poems was a complete success. At twenty-three he went to
Italy, in the capacity of George Sand&#39;s private secretary, fell
passionately in love with her, was jilted, and returned home
broken-hearted. This, however, did not prevent him from falling in love,
and out again, like Byron, at constant intervals throughout his life,
and celebrating the event in verses infinitely sweet and bitter. From
Louis Philippe, who had been his school-fellow, he received the post of
Librarian to the Minister of the Interior, which, however, he lost at
the Revolution of 1848. In 1852 he was elected to the French Academy;
but, though only forty-two, his health was already breaking. Like Byron,
who loved to write at midnight with a glass of gin-and-water at his
elbow, Musset used to prime himself with draughts of the still deadlier
absinthe. He sank, and died in May, 1857, leaving the greatest name of
all French poets except Victor Hugo, and a reputation as a writer of
prose stories which may be very fairly estimated by the specimen which
follows&mdash;the charming little story of &quot;Camille.&quot;]</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Scan318.jpg" alt="T" width="114" height="114" class="cap" />
<p class="cap">THE Chevalier des Arcis was a cavalry officer who,
having quitted the service in 1760, while still young, retired to a
country house near Mans. Shortly after, he married the daughter of a
retired merchant who lived in the neighbourhood, and this marriage
appeared for a time to be an exceedingly happy one. Cécile&#39;s
relatives were worthy folk who, enriched by means of hard work, were
now, in their latter years, enjoying a continual Sunday. The Chevalier,
weary of the artificial manners of Versailles, entered gladly into their
simple pleasures. Cécile had an excellent uncle, named Giraud, who had
been a master-bricklayer, but had risen by degrees to the position of
architect, and now owned considerable property. The Chevalier&#39;s
house (which was named Chardonneux) was much to Giraud&#39;s taste, and
he was there a frequent and ever welcome visitor.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">By and by a lovely little girl was born to the
Chevalier and Cécile, and great at first was the jubilation of the
parents. But a painful shock was in store for them. They soon made the
terrible discovery that their little Camille was deaf, and,
consequently, also dumb!</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="indent">The mother&#39;s first thought was of cure, but this
hope was reluctantly abandoned; no cure could be found. At the time of
which we are writing, there existed a pitiless prejudice against those
poor creatures whom we style <i>deaf mutes</i>. A few noble spirits, it
is true, had protested against this barbarity. A Spanish monk of the
sixteenth century was the first to devise means of teaching the dumb to
speak without words&mdash;a thing until then deemed impossible. His
example had been followed at different times in Italy, England, and
France, by Bonnet, Wallis, Bulwer, and Van Helmont, and a little good
had been done here and there. Still, however, even at Paris, deaf mutes
were generally regarded as beings set apart, marked with the brand of
Divine displeasure. Deprived of speech, the power of thought was denied
them, and they inspired more horror than pity.</p>

<p class="indent">A dark shadow crept over the happiness of
Camille&#39;s parents. A sudden, silent estrangement&mdash;worse than
divorce, crueller than death&mdash;grew up between them. For the mother
passionately loved her afflicted child, while the Chevalier, despite all
the efforts prompted by his kind heart, could not overcome the
repugnance with which her affliction affected him.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother spoke to her child by signs, and she alone
could make herself understood. Every other inmate of the house, even her
father, was a stranger to Camille. The mother of Madame des
Arcis&mdash;a woman of no tact&mdash;never ceased to deplore loudly the
misfortune that had befallen her daughter and son-in-law. &quot;Better
that she had never been born!&quot; she exclaimed one day.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
&quot;What would you have done, then, had <i>I</i> been thus?&quot;
asked Cécile indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">To Uncle Giraud his great-niece&#39;s dumbness seemed
no such tremendous misfortune. &quot;I have had,&quot; said he,
&quot;such a talkative wife that I regard everything else as a less
evil. This little woman will never speak or hear bad words, never
aggravate the whole household by humming opera airs, will never quarrel,
never awake when her husband coughs, or rises early to look after his
workmen. She will see clearly, for the deaf have good eyes. She will be
pretty and intelligent, and make no noise. Were I young, I would like to
marry her; being old, I will adopt her as my daughter whenever you are
tired of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment the sad parents were cheered by Uncle
Giraud&#39;s bright talk. But the cloud soon re-descended upon them.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="indent">In course of time the little girl grew into a big one.
Nature completed successfully, but faithfully, her task. The
Chevalier&#39;s feelings towards Camille had, unfortunately, undergone
no change. Her mother still watched over her tenderly, and never left
her, observing anxiously her slightest actions, her every sign of
interest in life.</p>

<p class="indent">When Camille&#39;s young friends were of an age to
receive the first instructions of a governess, the poor child began to
realise the difference between herself and others. The child of a
neighbour had a severe governess. Camille, who was present one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
day at a spelling-lesson, regarded her little comrade with surprise,
following her efforts with her eyes, seeking, as it were, to aid her,
and crying when she was scolded. Especially were the music-lessons
puzzling to Camille.</p>

<p class="indent">The evening prayers, which the neighbour used
regularly with her children, were another enigma for the girl. She knelt
with her friends, and joined her hands without knowing wherefore. The
Chevalier considered this a profanation; not so his wife. As Camille
advanced in age, she became possessed of a passion&mdash;as it were by a
holy instinct&mdash;for the churches which she beheld. &quot;When I was
a child I saw not God, I saw only the sky,&quot; is the saying of a deaf
mute. A religious procession, a coarse, gaudily bedizened image of the
Virgin, a choir boy in a shabby surplice, whose voice was all unheard by
Camille&mdash;who knows what simple means will serve to raise the eyes
of a child? And what matters it, so long as the eyes are raised?</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p class="indent">Camille was <i>petite</i>, with a white skin, and long
black hair, and graceful movements. She was swift to understand her
mother&#39;s wishes, prompt to obey them. So much grace and beauty,
joined to so much misfortune, were most disturbing to the Chevalier. He
would frequently embrace the girl in an excited manner, exclaiming
aloud: &quot;I am not yet a wicked man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the garden there was a wooded walk, to
which the Chevalier was in the habit of betaking himself after
breakfast. From her chamber window Madame des Arcis often watched him
wistfully as he walked to and fro beneath the trees. One morning, with
palpitating heart, she ventured to join him. She wished to take Camille
to a juvenile ball which was to be held that evening at a neighbouring
mansion. She longed to observe the effect which her daughter&#39;s
beauty would produce upon the outside world and upon her husband. She
had passed a sleepless night in devising Camille&#39;s toilette, and she
cherished the sweetest hopes. &quot;It must be,&quot; she told herself,
&quot;that he will be proud, and the rest jealous of the poor little
one! She will say nothing, but she will be the most beautiful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Chevalier welcomed his wife graciously&mdash;quite
in the manner of Versailles! Their conversation commenced with the
exchange of a few insignificant sentences as they walked side by side.
Then a silence fell between them, while Madame des Arcis sought fitting
words in which to approach her husband on the subject of Camille, and
induce him to break his resolution that the child should never see the
world. Meanwhile, the Chevalier was also in cogitation. He was the first
to speak. He informed his wife that urgent family affairs called him to
Holland, and that he ought to start not later than the following
morning.</p>

<p class="indent">Madame understood his true motive only too easily. The
Chevalier was far from contemplating the desertion of his wife, yet felt
an irresistible desire, a compelling need of temporary isolation. In
almost all true sorrow, man has this craving for
solitude&mdash;suffering animals have it also.</p>

<p class="indent">His wife raised no objection to his project, but fresh
grief wrung her heart. Complaining of weariness, she sank upon a seat.
There she remained for a long time, lost in sad reverie. She rose at
length, put her arm into that of her husband, and they returned together

<p class="caption">&quot;SHE SANK UPON A SEAT.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The poor lady spent the afternoon quietly and
prayerfully in her own room. In the evening, towards eight o&#39;clock,
she rang her bell, and ordered the horse to be put into the carriage. At
the same time she sent word to the Chevalier that she intended going to
the ball, and hoped that he would accompany her.</p>

<p class="indent">An embroidered robe of white muslin, small shoes of
white satin, a necklace of American beads, a coronet of
violets&mdash;such was the simple costume of Camille, who, when her
mother had dressed her, jumped for joy. As Madame was embracing her
child with the words, &quot;You are beautiful! you are beautiful!&quot;
the Chevalier joined them. He gave his hand to his wife, and the three
went to the ball.</p>

<p class="indent">As it was Camille&#39;s first appearance in public,
she naturally excited a great deal of curiosity. The Chevalier suffered
visibly. When his friends praised to him the beauty of his daughter, he
felt that they intended to console him, and such consolation was not to
his taste. Yet he could not wholly suppress some emotion of pride and
joy. His feelings were strangely mixed. After having saluted by gestures
almost everybody in the room, Camille was now resting by her
mother&#39;s side. The general admiration grew more enthusiastic.
Nothing, in fact, could have been more lovely than the envelope which
held this <span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
poor dumb soul. Her figure, her face, her long, curling hair, above all,
her eyes of incomparable lustre, surprised everyone. Her wistful looks
and graceful gestures, too, were so pathetic. People crowded around
Madame des Arcis, asking a thousand questions about Camille; to surprise
and a slight coldness succeeded sincere kindliness and sympathy. They
had never seen such a charming child; nothing resembled her, for there
existed nothing else so charming as she! Camille was a complete
success.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 514px;">
<img src="images/Scan321.jpg" width="514" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;IT WAS CAMILLE&#39;S FIRST APPEARANCE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Always outwardly calm, Madame des Arcis tasted
to-night the most pure and intense pleasure of her life. A smile that
was exchanged between her and her husband was well worth many tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently, as the Chevalier was still gazing at his
daughter, a country-dance began, which Camille watched with an earnest
attention that had in it something sad. A boy invited her to join. For
answer, she shook her head, causing some of the violets to fall out of
her coronet. Her mother picked them up, and soon put to rights the
coiffure, which was her own handiwork. Then she looked round for her
husband, but he was no longer in the room. She inquired if he had left,
and whether he had taken the carriage. She was told that he had gone
home on foot.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Chevalier had resolved to leave home without
taking leave of his wife. He shrank from all discussion and explanation,
and, as he intended to return in a short time, he believed that he
should act more wisely in leaving a letter than by making a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
verbal farewell. There was <i>some</i> truth in his statement of that
business affair calling him away, although business was not his first
consideration. And now one of his friends had written to hasten his
departure. Here was a good excuse. On returning alone to his house (by a
much shorter route than that taken by the carriage), he announced his
intention to the servants, packed in great haste, sent his light luggage
on to the town, mounted his horse, and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet a certain misgiving troubled him, for he knew that
his Cécile would be pained by his abrupt departure, although he
endeavoured to persuade himself that he did this for her sake no less
than for his own. However, he continued on his way.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Madame des Arcis was returning in the
carriage, with her daughter asleep upon her knee. She felt hurt at the
Chevalier&#39;s rudeness in leaving them to return alone. It seemed such
a public slight upon his wife and child! Sad forebodings filled the
mother&#39;s heart as the carriage jolted slowly over the stones of a
newly-made road. &quot;God watches over all,&quot; she reflected;
&quot;over us as over others. But what shall we do? What will become of
my poor child?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At some distance from Chardonneux there was a ford to
be crossed. There had been much rain for nearly a month past, causing
the river to overflow its banks. The ferryman refused at first to take
the carriage into his boat; he would undertake, he said, to convey the
passengers and the horse safely across, but not the vehicle. The lady,
anxious to rejoin her husband, would not descend. She ordered the
coachman to enter the boat; it was only a transit of a few minutes,
which she had made a hundred times.</p>

<p class="indent">In mid-stream the boat was forced by the current from
its straight course. The boatman asked the coachman&#39;s aid in keeping
it away from the weir. For there was not far off a mill with a weir,
where the violence of the water had formed a sort of cascade. It was
clear that if the boat drifted to this spot there would be a terrible
accident.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan322.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;IN MID-STREAM.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The coachman descended from his seat, and worked with
a will. But he had only a pole to work with, the night was dark, a fine
rain blinded the men, and soon the noise of the weir announced the most
imminent danger. Madame des Arcis, who had remained in the carriage,
opened the window in alarm. &quot;Are we then lost?&quot; cried she. At
that moment the pole broke. The two men fell into the boat exhausted,
and with bruised hands.</p>

<p class="indent">The ferryman could swim, but not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
coachman. There was no time to lose. &quot;Père Georgeot,&quot; said
Madame to the ferryman, calling him by his name, &quot;can you save my
daughter and myself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly!&quot; he replied, as if almost
insulted by the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What must we do?&quot; inquired Madame des
Arcis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Place yourself upon my shoulders,&quot; replied
the ferryman, &quot;and put your arms about my neck. As for the little
one, I will hold her in one hand, and swim with the other, and she shall
not get drowned. It is but a short distance from here to the potatoes
which grow in yonder field.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Jean?&quot; asked Madame, meaning the
coachman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jean will be all right, I hope. If he holds on
at the weir, I will return for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Père Georgeot struck out with his double burden, but
he had over-estimated his powers. He was no longer young. The shore was
farther off, the current stronger than he had thought. He struggled
manfully, but was nearly swept away. Then the trunk of a willow, hidden
by the water and the darkness, stopped him suddenly with a violent blow
upon the forehead. Blood flowed from the wound and obscured his
vision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could you save my child if you had only her to
convey?&quot; asked the mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot tell, but I <i>think</i> so,&quot; said
the ferryman.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother removed her arms from the man&#39;s neck,
and let herself slip gently into the water.</p>

<p class="indent">When the ferryman had deposited Camille safely on
<i>terra firma</i>, the coachman, who had been rescued by a peasant,
helped him to search for the body of Madame des Arcis. It was found on
the following morning, near the bank.</p>

<p class="caption">THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF MADAME DES ARCIS.</p>
</div>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p class="indent">Camille&#39;s grief at her mother&#39;s loss was
terrible to witness. She ran hither and thither, uttering wild,
inarticulate cries, tearing her hair, and beating the walls. An
unnatural calm succeeded these violent emotions; reason itself seemed
well-nigh gone.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then that Uncle Giraud came to his niece&#39;s
rescue. &quot;Poor child!&quot; said he, &quot;she has at present
neither father nor mother. With me she has always been a favourite, and
I intend now to take charge of her for a time. Change of scene,&quot;
said Uncle Giraud, &quot;would do her a world of good.&quot; With the
Chevalier&#39;s permission (obtained by letter), he carried off Camille
to Paris. The Chevalier returned to Chardonneux, where he lived in
deepest retirement, shunning every living being, a prey to grief and
keen remorse.</p>

<p class="indent">A year passed heavily away. Uncle Giraud had as yet
failed utterly to rouse Camille. She steadily refused to be interested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
in anything. At last, one day he determined to take her, <i>nolens
volens</i>, to the opera. A new and beautiful dress was purchased for
the occasion. When, attired in this, Camille saw herself in the glass,
so pleased was she with the pretty picture that, to her good uncle&#39;s
intense satisfaction, she actually smiled!</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p class="indent">Camille soon wearied of the opera. All&mdash;actors,
musicians, audience&mdash;seemed to say to her:&mdash;&quot;We speak,
and you cannot; we hear, laugh, sing, rejoice. You rejoice in nothing,
hear nothing. You are only a statue, the simulacrum of a being, a mere
looker-on at life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When, to exclude the mocking spectacle, she closed her
eyes, the scenes of her early life rose before the eyes of her mind. She
returned in thought to her country home, saw again her mother&#39;s dear
face. It was too much! Uncle Giraud observed, with much concern, tears
rolling down her cheeks. When he would have inquired the cause of her
grief, she made signs that she wished to leave. She rose, and opened the
door of the box.</p>

<p class="indent">Just at this moment, something attracted her
attention. She caught sight of a good-looking, richly-dressed young man,
who was tracing letters and figures with a white pencil upon a small
slate. He exhibited this slate now and then to his neighbour, a man
older than himself, who evidently understood him at once, and promptly
replied in the same manner. At the same time the two exchanged signs.</p>

<p class="indent">Camille&#39;s curiosity and interest were deeply
stirred. She had already observed that this young man&#39;s lips did not
move. She now saw that he spoke a language which was not the language of
others, that he had found some means of expressing himself without the
aid of speech&mdash;that art for her so incomprehensible and impossible.
An irresistible longing to see more seized her. She leaned over the edge
of the box, and watched the stranger&#39;s movements attentively. When
he again wrote something upon his slate, and passed it to his companion,
she made an involuntary gesture as if to take it. Whereupon the young
man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
in his turn, looked at Camille. Their eyes met, and said the same thing,
&quot;We two are in like case; we are both dumb.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/Scan324.jpg" width="600" height="456" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;SHE LEANED OVER THE EDGE OF THE BOX.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Uncle Giraud brought his niece&#39;s wrap, but she no
longer wished to go. She had reseated herself, and was leaning eagerly
forward.</p>

<p class="indent">The Abbé de l&#39;Epée was then just becoming known.
Touched with pity for the deaf and dumb, this good man had invented a
language that he deemed superior to that of Leibnitz. He restored deaf
mutes to the ranks of their fellows by teaching them to read and write.
Alone and unaided he laboured for his afflicted fellow-creatures,
prepared to sacrifice to their welfare his life and fortune.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man observed by Camille was one of the
Abbé&#39;s first pupils. He was the son of the Marquis de Maubray.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p class="indent">It goes without saying that neither Camille nor her
uncle knew anything either of the Abbé de l&#39;Epée, or of his new
method. Camille&#39;s mother would assuredly have discovered it, had she
lived long enough. But Chardonneux was far from Paris; the Chevalier did
not take <i>The Gazette</i>, nor, if he had taken it, would he have read
it. Thus a few leagues of distance, a little indolence, or death, may
produce the same result.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon Camille&#39;s return from the opera, she was
possessed with but one idea. She made her uncle understand that she
wished for writing materials. Although the good man wanted his supper,
he ran to his chamber, and returned with a piece of board and a morsel
of chalk, relics of his old love for building and carpentry.</p>

<p class="indent">Camille placed the board upon her knee, then made
signs to her uncle that he should sit by her and write something upon
it. Laying his hand gently upon the girl&#39;s breast, he wrote, in
large letters, her name, <i>Camille</i>, after which, well satisfied
with the evening&#39;s work, he seated himself at the supper-table.</p>

<p class="indent">Camille retired as soon as possible to her own room,
clasping her board in her arms. Having laid aside some of her finery,
and let down her hair, she began to copy with great pains and care the
word which her uncle had written. After writing it many times, she
succeeded in forming the letters very fairly. What that word represented
to her, who shall say?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/Scan325.jpg" width="295" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;SHE BEGAN TO COPY WITH GREAT CARE.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was a glorious night of July. Camille had opened
her window, and from time to time paused in her self-imposed task to
gaze out, although the &quot;view&quot; was but a dreary one. The window
overlooked a yard in which coaches were kept. Four or five huge
carriages stood side by side beneath a shed. Two or three others stood
in the centre of the yard, as if awaiting the horses which could be
heard kicking in the stable. The court was shut in by a closed door and
high walls.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Camille perceived, beneath the shadow of a
heavy diligence, a human form pacing to and fro. A feeling of fear
seized her. The man was gazing intently at her window. In a few moments
Camille had regained her courage. She took her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
lamp in her hand, and, leaning from the casement, held it so that its
light illumined the court. The Marquis de Maubray (for it was he),
perceiving that he was discovered, sank on his knees and clasped his
hands, gazing at Camille meanwhile with an expression of respectful
admiration. Then he sprang up, and nimbly clambering over two or three
intercepting vehicles, was in a few minutes within Camille&#39;s room,
where his first act was to make her a profound bow. He longed for some
means of speaking to her, and, observing upon the table the board
bearing the written word <i>Camille</i>, he took the piece of chalk, and
proceeded to write beside that name his own&mdash;<i>Pierre</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 679px;">
<img src="images/Scan326.jpg" width="679" height="653" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;HE WAS IN A FEW MINUTES WITHIN CAMILLE&#39;S ROOM.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you? and what are you doing here?&quot;
thundered a wrathful voice. It was that of Uncle Giraud, who at that
moment entered the room, and bestowed upon the intruder a torrent of
abuse. The Marquis calmly wrote something upon the board, and handed it
to Uncle Giraud, who read with amazement the following words: &quot;I
love Mademoiselle Camille, and wish to marry her. I am the Marquis de
Maubray; will you give her to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The uncle&#39;s wrath abated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; remarked he to himself, as he
recognised the youth he had seen at the opera&mdash;&quot;for going
straight to the point, and getting through their business quickly, I
never saw the like of these dumb folk!&quot;</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p class="indent">The course of true love, for once, ran smooth. The
Chevalier&#39;s consent to this highly desirable match for his daughter
was easily obtained. Much more difficult was it to convince him that it
was possible to teach deaf mutes to read and write. Seeing, however, is
believing. One day, two or three years after the marriage, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
Chevalier received a letter from Camille, which began
thus:&mdash;&quot;Oh, father! I can speak, not with my mouth, but with
my hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She told him how she had learned to do this, and to
whom she owed her new-born speech&mdash;the good Abbé de l&#39;Epée. She
described to him the beauty of her baby, and affectionately besought him
to pay a visit to his daughter and grandchild.</p>

<p class="indent">After receiving this letter, the Chevalier hesitated
for a long time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, by all means,&quot; advised Uncle Giraud,
when he was consulted. &quot;Do you not reproach yourself continually
for having deserted your wife at the ball? Will you also forsake your
child, who longs to see you? Let us go together. I consider it most
ungrateful of her not to have included me in the invitation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is right,&quot; reflected the Chevalier.
&quot;I brought cruel and needless suffering upon the best of women. I
left her to die a frightful death, when I ought to have been her
preserver. If this visit to Camille involves some pain to myself, that
is but a merited chastisement. I will taste this bitter pleasure; I will
go and see my child.&quot;</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p class="indent">In the pretty boudoir of a house in the Faubourg St.
Germain, Camille&#39;s father and uncle found Camille and Pierre. Upon
the table lay books and sketches. The husband was reading, the wife
embroidering, the child playing on the carpet. At sight of the welcome
visitors the Marquis rose, while Camille ran to her father, who, as he
embraced her tenderly, could not restrain his tears. Then the
Chevalier&#39;s earnest look was bent upon the child. In spite of
himself, some shadow of the repugnance he had formerly felt for the
infirmity of Camille stirred afresh at sight of this small being who had
doubtless inherited that infirmity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another mute!&quot; cried he.</p>

<p class="indent">Camille raised her son to her arms; without hearing
she had understood. Gently holding out the child towards the Chevalier,
she placed her fingers upon the tiny lips, stroking them a little, as if
coaxing them to speak. In a few moments he pronounced distinctly the
words which his mother had caused him to be taught:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, papa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you see clearly,&quot; said Uncle Giraud,
&quot;that God pardons everything and for ever!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">[Quatrelles&#39; real name is Ernest Louis Victor
Jules L&#39;Épine. He lives at Paris&mdash;a grey old gentleman of
sixty-five, who during the greater part of his life has held a post in
the French Government, who wears in his button-hole the rosette of the
Legion of Honour, and who can do almost anything
delightful&mdash;whether it be to paint a picture, or to compose a piece

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Scan328-1.jpg" alt="T" width="114" height="113" class="cap" />
<p class="cap">THERE was once, in Japan, in times so far away that the
learned hardly now dare speak of them, a poor little stone-breaker who
worked on the highways.</p> </div>

<p class="indent">He worked on the highways as long as the day lasted,
in all weathers, in all seasons, in rain, in the burning sunshine, and
in snow. He was always half dead with fatigue and three-quarters dead
with hunger; and he was not at all contented with his lot. &quot;Oh! how
I would bless heaven,&quot; he said, &quot;if one day I became rich
enough to sleep far into the morning, to eat when I was hungry, and
drink when I was athirst. I am told that there are people so blessed by
fate as always to be gay and full of food. Stretched at ease upon thick
mats before my door, my back covered with soft silken vestments, I would
take my afternoon nap, wakened every quarter of an hour by a servant,
who should remind me that I had nothing to do, and that I might sleep
without remorse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A passing angel overheard these words, and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be it according to your wish, poor man!&quot;
the angel said. And, suddenly, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
stone-breaker found himself before the door of a splendid dwelling of
his own, stretched at his ease upon a pile of thick mats and dressed in
sumptuous garments of silk. He was no longer hungry, no longer thirsty,
no longer tired&mdash;all of which appeared to him as agreeable as it
was surprising.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;BEFORE THE DOOR OF A SPLENDID DWELLING.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">He had feasted for half an hour on these unknown
enjoyments, when the Mikado passed by. The Mikado! It was a great thing
to be the Mikado. The Mikado was Emperor of Japan, and the Emperor of
Japan was, especially in those far-off times, the most powerful of all
the emperors of the East.</p>

<p class="indent">The Mikado was travelling for his pleasure, preceded
by couriers, surrounded by cavaliers more embroidered and belaced than
the Grand Turk of Turkey, followed by famous warriors, escorted by
musicians, accompanied by the most beautiful women in the world, who
reclined in howdahs of silver borne on the backs of white elephants.</p>

<p class="indent">The Mikado lay upon a bed of down in a palanquin of
fine gold, decked with precious stones. His prime minister had the
unequalled honour of holding above his master&#39;s head a large
umbrella fringed all round with tiny jingling bells.</p>

<p class="indent">The enriched stone-breaker followed the imperial
procession with an eye of envy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Much advanced I am!&quot; he said to himself.
&quot;Shall I be happy with the few paltry indulgences I am able to give
myself? Why am I not the Mikado? I could then traverse the highways in a
splendid carriage, in a golden palanquin powdered with precious stones,
followed by my prime minister, under the shade of a great umbrella
fringed with jingling bells, while my second minister refreshed my
visage with the waving of a fan of peacocks&#39; feathers. Ah, I wish I
were the Mikado!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be as you wish to be!&quot; said the angel.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;SURROUNDED BY HIS MINISTERS.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">And instantly he found himself stretched on the down
bed of the golden palanquin powdered with precious stones, surrounded by
his ministers, his warriors, his women and his slaves, who said to him,
in Japanese:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mikado, you are superior to the sun, you are
eternal, you are invincible. All that the mind of man can conceive you
can execute. Justice itself is subordinate to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
your will, and providence waits on your counsels tremblingly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stone-breaker said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good! these people know my value.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sun, which had been shining very ardently for some
days, had parched the country. The road was dusty, and the glare from it
fatigued the eyes of the apprentice Mikado, who, addressing his
minister, the bearer of the jingling umbrella, said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Inform the sun that he is incommoding me. His
familiarities displease me. Tell him that the great Emperor of Japan
authorises him to retire. Go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The prime minister confided to a chamberlain the
honour of carrying the jingling umbrella, and went on his mission.</p>

<p class="indent">He returned almost instantly, his face expressing the
utmost consternation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Emperor, sovereign of gods and men, it is
inconceivable! The sun pretends not to have heard me, and continues to
burn up the road!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let him be chastised.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly! such insolence deserves it; but how
am I to get hold of him to administer his punishment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I not the equal of the gods?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Assuredly, great Mikado, at least their
equal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You told me, just now, that nothing is
impossible to me. Either you have lied, or you resist me, or you have
badly executed my orders; I give you five minutes to extinguish the sun,
or ten to have your head chopped off. Go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The prime minister departed, and did not return.</p>

<p class="indent">The exasperated stone-breaker was purple with
anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a pretty sort of a dog&#39;s business,
upon my word, to be emperor, if he has to submit to the familiarities,
caprices, and brutalities of a mere circulating star. It is plain that
the sun is more powerful than I. I wish I were the sun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be it as you wish!&quot; said the angel.</p>

<p class="indent">And the little stone-breaker sparkled in the highest
heavens, radiant, flaming. He took pleasure in scorching trees,
withering their leaves, and parching up springs; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
covering with perspiration the august visages of emperors as well as the
dusty muzzles of the wayside stone-breakers&mdash;his companions of the
morning.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;THE LITTLE STONE-BREAKER SPARKLED IN THE HEAVENS.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">But a cloud came between the earth and him, and the
cloud said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Halt, my dear fellow; you can&#39;t come this
way!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the moon, that&#39;s too much! A
cloud&mdash;a poor little misty, bodiless cloud&mdash;calls me
familiarly, &#39;my dear fellow,&#39; and bars my way! Clouds, it is
plain, are more powerful than I. If I do not become a cloud, I shall
burst with jealousy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t burst for so trifling a cause,&quot;
said the angel, always on the watch. &quot;Be a cloud, since you prefer
to be so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Proudly the new cloud planted himself between the
earth and the resplendent planet.</p>

<p class="indent">Never, in the records of memory, did so much rain
fall. The transformed stone-breaker took pleasure in launching rain and
hail upon the earth, and that in such a terrible fashion that the
uprooted trees found nothing left but mud in which to hold on to the
ground. Under his aquatic reign of several hours, streams became floods,
floods became torrents, the seas were confounded with each other, and
dreadful waterspouts whirled in every direction, wringing and destroying
whatever was above the surface of the waters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/Scan330-2.jpg" width="315" height="554" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;NEVER DID SO MUCH RAIN FALL.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">A rock, however, made head against the force of the
hurricane. In spite of all, it remained unmoved. On its granite sides
the waves broke in frothy showers, the waterspouts sank at its feet, and
the thunder made it laugh every time it burst against its unyielding
flanks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am at the end of my powers!&quot; said the
cloud; &quot;this rock defies me, masters me, and fills me with
envy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take its place!&quot; said the angel, &quot;and
let us see whether, at last, you are satisfied.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The transformed cloud did not yet feel at his ease.
Immovable, inaccessible, insensible to the burning caresses of the sun
and to the booming of the thunder, he believed himself to be the master
of the world. But at his feet a sharp hammering sound attracted his
attention. He stooped and beheld a wretched being covered with rags,
thin and bald, as he had been in the time of his deepest poverty, who,
with a heavy hammer in his hand, was engaged in chipping off pieces of
the granite for the purpose of mending the neighbouring road.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">&quot;AT HIS FEET A SHARP HAMMERING SOUND ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; cried the
haughty rock; &quot;a poor wretch&mdash;wretched amongst the most
wretched&mdash;mutilating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
me, and I cannot defend myself! I am profoundly humiliated&mdash;reduced
to envy the lot even of this wretched being!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take his place!&quot; said the angel,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">And the insatiate personage became again what he had
been before&mdash;a poor little stone-breaker. As in the past, he worked
on the highways as long as day lasted, in all weathers, in all seasons,
in rain, in the burning sunshine, and in snow. He was always half dead
with hunger, three-quarters dead with fatigue. But that did not prevent
his being perfectly contented with his lot.</p>

<p class="indent">Throughout the dialogues, there were words used to
mimic accents of the speakers. Those words were retained as-is.</p>

<p class="indent">The illustrations have been moved so that they do not
break up paragraphs and so that they are next to the text they
illustrate. In the article <i>Pictures With Histories</i>, there are two
internal references to "page 232" (for a painting of Miss Gale) and to
"page 233" (for a sketch of hidden Gainsborough). The hyperlinks are to
the illustrations rather than the pages.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
